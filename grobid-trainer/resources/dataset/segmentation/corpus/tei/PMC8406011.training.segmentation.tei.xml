			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute <lb/>respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread <lb/>worldwide and was declared a pandemic in early 2020. COVID-19 <lb/>destroyed people&apos;s mental and physical health and staggered <lb/>global economic growth. As of May 18, 2021, 163 million <lb/>infections, including 3.38 million deaths, have been recorded <lb/>(source: World Health Organization). SARS-CoV-2 invades the <lb/>host by virtue of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) <lb/>receptors broadly distributed on various tissues and immune <lb/>cells. 1-5 The virus can cause a wide range of clinical manifesta-<lb/>tions from mild forms such as fever, cough, and myalgia to <lb/>moderate forms requiring hospitalization (pneumonia and <lb/>localized inflammation) to severe/critical forms with fatal out-<lb/>comes. 6,7 Severe or critical infection often manifests as pneu-<lb/>monia, 8,9 disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute <lb/>respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), low blood pressure, and <lb/>multiorgan failure (Fig. 1). 9-11 <lb/>Several lines of evidence have shown that immunopathological <lb/>damage may be responsible for the deterioration of COVID-19. <lb/>Particularly, multiple studies have reported that highly elevated <lb/>levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced during the <lb/>crosstalk between epithelial cells and immune cells in COVID-19, <lb/>which has linked the cytokine storm (CS) with the severe <lb/>complications and poor outcomes in this infection. 12-14 <lb/>CS is a fast-developing, life-threatening, clinical condition in <lb/>which the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and <lb/>excessive activation of immune cells lead to complicated medical <lb/>syndromes from a persistent fever, nonspecific muscle pain, and <lb/>hypotension, to capillary leak syndrome, DIC, ARDS, hemopha-<lb/>gocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), multiorgan failure, and death if <lb/>treatment is not adequate. 15 Therefore, the timing of diagnosis <lb/>and treatment of CS could be life-saving. The term CS was first <lb/>used in 1993 in graft-versus-host disease, 16 and later, in many <lb/>inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune conditions, organ <lb/>transplantation, cancer chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell <lb/>therapy, and, most recently, in COVID-19. 17-23 However, the <lb/>profile and causative effect of CS in different conditions can <lb/>greatly vary. Thus far, precise diagnosis and treatment guidelines <lb/>for CS in most of the conditions are lacking. Understanding the <lb/>definite alterations and pathogenic roles of individual cytokines <lb/>involved in the COVID-19-related CS (COVID-CS) is hence <lb/>extremely important for the development of precise diagnosis <lb/>and effective treatment. <lb/>Although some aspects of this topic have been partly reviewed <lb/>previously, a comprehensive view of COVID-CS to facilitate its <lb/></body>

			<body>diagnosis and treatment is still lacking with unmet clinical needs. <lb/>Herein, we provide an updated and full scenario of COVID-CS from <lb/>basic research to clinical diagnosis, treatment, and trials. Initially, <lb/>we discuss the currently identified immunopathological features <lb/>of COVID-19, especially the CS; its mechanism of action and <lb/>differences with respect to CS in other disease conditions; and <lb/>individual cytokines involved in the COVID-CS including their <lb/>pathological role, downstream signaling, and existing interven-<lb/>tions. In addition, the challenges and prospects in the diagnosis <lb/>and treatment of COVID-CS are also discussed. <lb/>THE IMMUNOPATHOLOGY OF COVID-19 <lb/>In general, patients with COVID-19 present with an abnormal <lb/>immune landscape, characterized by overactivated inflammatory, <lb/>innate immune response, and impaired protective, adaptive <lb/>immune response. This is primarily responsible for the immuno-<lb/>pathology of severe COVID-19. Thus far, evidence from both <lb/>clinical trials and basic research has revealed several key features <lb/>of immunopathology in severe COVID-19, including lymphopenia, <lb/>antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), neutrophilia, dysregula-<lb/>tion of monocytes and macrophages, reduced or delayed type I <lb/>interferon (IFN-I) response, and CS (Fig. 2). <lb/>Lymphopenia <lb/>Lymphopenia was commonly found in COVID-19 patients 10,11 <lb/>and is closely correlated with the illness severity. 24,25 Laboratory <lb/>results showed that the counts and percentages of lymphocytes <lb/>including CD4 + T, CD8 + cytotoxic T, 26,27 natural killer (NK), 24 and <lb/>B cells 25 were all reduced in COVID-19 patients. 28-31 Evidence <lb/>from single-cell sequencing, 32 flow cytometry, 33 and nonhuman <lb/>primate models of COVID-19 34 confirmed the involvement of <lb/>lymphopenia to the maximum extent. In addition, T cells <lb/>exhibited exhaustion phenotypes with the expression of higher <lb/>levels of exhaustion markers including programmed cell <lb/>death protein-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin <lb/>domain-3, suggesting that these T cells may have regulatory <lb/>activities. 26,27 Other investigations showed that the PD-1-or NK <lb/>group 2 member A-positive NK cells were also significantly <lb/>increased in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients <lb/>compared to healthy controls. 35,36 <lb/>Several mechanisms may contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced <lb/>depletion and exhaustion of lymphocytes: (1) SARS-CoV-2 may <lb/>directly infect T cells via ACE2 receptor expressed on T cells, 37 <lb/>which results in T cell death; 38,39 (2) several pro-inflammatory or <lb/>anti-inflammatory cytokines can accelerate the depletion and <lb/>exhaustion of T cells with their respective functions. In addition, <lb/>the virus may destroy secondary lymphoid tissues spleen and <lb/>lymph nodes, leading to lymphopenia, which is supported by the <lb/>observations of splenic atrophy, lymph node necrosis, and <lb/>decreased lymphocyte numbers; 24,40-42 (3) a nonhuman primate <lb/>COVID-19 model showed that the impaired anti-viral T cell <lb/>response may be attributed to the increased numbers of <lb/>regulatory T cells (Tregs). 34 However, we cannot exclude the <lb/>possibility that depletion and exhaustion of lymphocytes resulted <lb/>from anti-inflammatory therapies such as the administration of <lb/>glucocorticoids. <lb/>Collectively, lymphopenia may represent a poor outcome of the <lb/>illness. A retrospective, multicenter, emergency clinical trial in a <lb/>Han Chinese population including 14,117 normal controls and 69 <lb/>hospitalized COVID-19 patients (25 severe or critical and 44 mild) <lb/>showed that lymphopenia occurred in almost 100% of the severe/ <lb/>critical cases, and the number of lymphocytes progressively <lb/>decreased with the progression of the disease and deterioration of <lb/>clinical status. The CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocyte subsets showed <lb/>a marked difference between mild and severe cases. Therefore, <lb/>the authors suggested that analyzing the counts and percentages <lb/>of lymphocytes at admission immediately contributes to improved <lb/>clinical prognosis. 43 <lb/>Antibody-dependent enhancement <lb/>B cells are considered protective in SARS-CoV-2 infection by <lb/>producing neutralizing antibodies against the ACE2 receptor to <lb/>prevent viral entry. 44 However, B cell-produced neutralizing <lb/>antibodies are not necessarily protective, depending on the <lb/>virus element it targets and also the Fc region of the antibody. <lb/>ADE is a phenomenon wherein pre-existing neutralizing anti-<lb/>bodies targeting one serotype of a given virus enhance the <lb/>entry of not only that virus but also another serotype of the virus <lb/>into leukocytes through the interaction between the Fc regions <lb/>of the antibody and Fc receptors or complement receptors on <lb/>such cells. 45-49 The ADE phenomenon has been found in various <lb/>viral infections such as dengue, Flavivirus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, <lb/>and Ebola. 45,48,50-52 <lb/>Recent studies have shown that relatively high levels of B cells <lb/>or antibodies are positively associated with COVID-19 sever-<lb/>ity, 32,53,54 implying the potential involvement of ADE in SARS-CoV-<lb/>2 infection. In addition, a study has reported that the monoclonal <lb/>antibody MW05 targeting SARS-CoV-2 may also induce ADE <lb/>activity by binding to FcÎ³RIIB receptors on the target cells in vitro. <lb/>However, administration of an engineered antibody with Fc region <lb/>mutation in vivo effectively protected animals from SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>infection. 55 This highlights the importance of developing protec-<lb/>tive neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, <lb/>further investigations about ADE in SARS-CoV-2 infection are <lb/>required to facilitate the development of vaccine-or antibody-<lb/>based therapy for COVID-19. <lb/>Neutrophilia <lb/>An increase in neutrophil count in COVID-19 patients is widely <lb/>recognized. It is well known that under normal conditions, <lb/>neutrophils play a protective role against infections by producing <lb/>neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to kill extracellular patho-<lb/>gens; 56 however, excessive neutrophil activation can also damage <lb/>the surrounding cells and dissolve connective tissues. 57 <lb/>Fig. 1 A systemic clinical manifestations of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>infects airway epithelial cells or immune cells via binding to ACE2 <lb/>receptors, causing tissue damage and release of DAMPs, as well as <lb/>production of inflammatory cytokines by epithelial cells and <lb/>immune cells. Then, the crosstalk between epithelial cells and <lb/>immune cells leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations, from <lb/>mild forms (e.g., fever, cough, and myalgia); to moderate forms <lb/>requiring hospitalization (pneumonia and localized inflammation); <lb/>to severe/critical forms with a fatal outcome that are manifested as <lb/>pneumonia, ARDS, DIC, CS, and multiorgan failure.

			<body>An earlier clinical trial including 138 patients from Wuhan, <lb/>China, showed that neutrophil counts were increased in non-<lb/>survivors compared to survivors and continued to increase until <lb/>death in the non-survivors. 11 Another clinical study that integrated <lb/>transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic platforms showed <lb/>that neutrophil counts were increased in patients with severe, but <lb/>not mild, COVID-19 as compared to healthy controls, and <lb/>molecules associated with NETs were significantly upregulated <lb/>in severe COVID-19 cases. 58 <lb/>The increased neutrophils manifested as both increased <lb/>numbers of mature and immature cells. In a clinical trial that <lb/>integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing with single-cell proteomics <lb/>of blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), <lb/>immature neutrophil precursors, and dysfunctional mature <lb/>neutrophils expressing programmed death-ligand 1 appeared in <lb/>severe COVID-19 cases. 59 In addition, a single-cell sequencing <lb/>analysis by Wilk et al. 32 and a flow cytometry analysis by Ronit <lb/>et al. 33 also identified the appearance of neutrophil progenitors at <lb/>various developmental stages in PBMCs or bronchoalveolar lavage <lb/>fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. <lb/>Although the mechanism by which the virus promotes <lb/>neutrophil development in COVID-19 is still poorly understood, <lb/>McElvaney et al. 60 found that the levels of pyruvate kinase M2 <lb/>(PKM2), a regulator of glycolysis 61 and coactivator of hypoxia-<lb/>inducible factor-1Î±, 62 as well as phosphorylated PKM2 were <lb/>higher in the neutrophils of COVID-19 patients in the ICU than in <lb/>those of non-ICU COVID-19 patients. This indicates that neutro-<lb/>phils undergo immunometabolic reprogramming in severe <lb/>COVID-19 cases, which represents a potential intervention target <lb/>for excessive neutrophil generation and activation in severe or <lb/>critical COVID-19. <lb/>Dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages <lb/>Monocytes and macrophages are the major innate immune cells in <lb/>infection and inflammation not just by virtue of their higher <lb/>numbers but also by their functions. A single-cell RNA-sequencing <lb/>analysis showed that classic CD14 + monocytes were significantly <lb/>increased, whereas nonclassical CD16 + monocytes and intermediate <lb/>CD14 + CD16 + monocytes were remarkably reduced in the blood of <lb/>COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. Classical monocytes can <lb/>differentiate into macrophages in tissue to initiate an inflammatory <lb/>response, whereas nonclassical monocytes were viewed as anti-<lb/>inflammatory as they can maintain vascular homeostasis, 63 which <lb/>may explain the phenotypic shift of circulating monocytes from <lb/>CD16 + to CD14 + . Analysis of the differentiation profiles of BALF and <lb/>circulating monocyte-macrophages from the same patient revealed <lb/>a transition course of blood-toward-BALF. More importantly, multi-<lb/>ple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were highly <lb/>expressed by the BALF monocyte-macrophages, suggesting that <lb/>the cells are inflamed. 64 Another single-cell sequencing analysis of <lb/>peripheral blood samples also showed that CD16 + monocytes were <lb/>remarkably depleted in COVID-19 patients with ARDS, with a <lb/>phenotypic shift from CD16 + to CD14 + . However, significant <lb/>upregulation of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines or <lb/>chemokines were not found in peripheral monocytes, indicating that <lb/>peripheral monocytes may not be responsible for the progression of <lb/>CS in COVID-19. 32 Moreover, phenotyping leukocyte subpopulations <lb/>in BALF and blood of COVID-19 patients with ARDS showed that the <lb/>expression of activation markers such as CD16, CD64, CD69, and <lb/>HLA-DR was higher in BALF macrophages than in peripheral <lb/>macrophages. 33 Collectively, these existing studies were generally <lb/>consistent and revealed the course of blood-toward-BALF transition <lb/>and the contribution of pulmonary monocyte-macrophages to CS <lb/>Fig. 2 The key immunopathology of severe COVID-19. The immunopathological manifestations of COVID-19 include lymphopenia, <lb/>dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages, neutrophilia, ADE, reduced or delayed IFN-I response, and CS. Lymphopenia is commonly <lb/>observed in severe COVID-19. In addition to decreased counts, lymphocytes often exhibit exhaustion phenotypes with the expression of <lb/>higher levels of exhaustion markers PD-1, Tim-3, or NKG2A. Peripheral monocytes present a phenotype shift from CD16 + to CD14 + , and BALF <lb/>macrophages are increased with a blood-to-BALF transition course. Neutrophil counts are increased with the presence of neutrophil <lb/>precursors in peripheral blood, especially in patients with severe COVID-19. The possible existence of ADE enhances the entry of SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>into cells through interaction between Fc regions and Fc receptors, leading to the aggravation of COVID-19. A CS is characterized by highly <lb/>elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and is a particularly central feature for poor outcomes in patients with severe or critical <lb/>infection. Reduced or delayed IFN-I response impedes viral clearance and induces paradoxical hyperinflammation, thus leading to the <lb/>deterioration of prognosis in COVID-19 patients.

			<body>via the release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and <lb/>chemokines during severe COVID-19. <lb/>Interestingly, a two-cohort study showed that activated HLA-<lb/>DR high CD11c high CD14 + monocytes were increased in the PBMCs of <lb/>patients with mild COVID-19, whereas dysfunctional HLA-<lb/>DR low CD163 high (indicative of anti-inflammatory function) CD14 + <lb/>monocytes were observed in severe COVID-19 cases. 59 This merits <lb/>further investigation to understand the underlying mechanism <lb/>and clinical significance. <lb/>Reduced or delayed IFN-I response <lb/>The IFN-I response is the first line of protective response and <lb/>critical to combat viral infections by promoting viral clearance and <lb/>regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. 65 Although the <lb/>detailed mechanism is still unknown when the infection occurs, <lb/>the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus may be recognized by innate <lb/>immune cells via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including <lb/>toll-like receptor (TLR); retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like <lb/>receptors (RLRs)/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 <lb/>(MDA5); and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). 66 Subsequently, down-<lb/>stream transcription factors including nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB), <lb/>activator protein-1 (AP-1), and IFN regulatory factor 3/7 (IRF3/7) <lb/>are activated to promote the transcription of pro-inflammatory <lb/>cytokines and IFN-I. The IFN-I can activate the Janus kinase 1 <lb/>(JAK1)/tyrosine kinase 2-signal transducer and activator of <lb/>transcription 1/2 (STAT1/2) pathway, promoting the formation of <lb/>the STAT1/2/IRF9 complex and initiating transcription of IFN-<lb/>stimulated genes (ISGs) (Fig. 3). 66,67 <lb/>However, accumulating evidence has suggested that the <lb/>protective IFN-I response was remarkably reduced in severe <lb/>COVID-19 patients. 26,68,69 At least two mechanisms have been <lb/>proposed to explain the deficient IFN-I response: (1) previous <lb/>studies have suggested that SARS-CoV employs various mechan-<lb/>isms to inhibit IFN response, especially through the components <lb/>of its structural proteins such as M protein, 70 N protein, 71 open-<lb/>reading frame 3a (ORF3a) protein, 72 and ORF6 protein. 73 <lb/>Considering that the structure of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of <lb/>SARS-CoV, it can be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 may exert similar <lb/>effects on IFN response. For example, Yang et al. 74 found that the <lb/>NSP1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 can inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation <lb/>and ISG transcription. (2) Decreased plasmacytoid dendritic cells <lb/>(pDCs) may be partly responsible for the deficient IFN-I response. <lb/>Sufficient evidence has suggested that pDC is a prominent <lb/>producer of IFN-I upon viral infection. 75-77 However, existing <lb/>studies showed that counts of pDCs were decreased in the blood <lb/>of COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. 26,32 <lb/>Of note, although the levels of systemic IFN-I were low, local <lb/>IFN-I and ISGs were noticeable in the BALF of some critically ill <lb/>patients, 78 which are related to the phenomenon of delayed IFN-I <lb/>response. 69 Evidence has confirmed that a delayed IFN-I response <lb/>not only impedes viral clearance but also induces paradoxical <lb/>hyperinflammation, thereby aggravating the immunopathological <lb/>response. 79,80 Collectively, these studies suggest that IFN-I-based <lb/>therapy for COVID-19 should be applied as early as possible after <lb/>the infection is confirmed. <lb/>Cytokine storm <lb/>In this section, we systemically review and discuss the character-<lb/>istics, possible induction mechanism, pathogenesis, and diagnosis <lb/>of CS in COVID-19. <lb/>Sufficient evidence has revealed the components and character-<lb/>istics of CS in the patients with severe COVID-19, which are <lb/>composed of an array of cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), 2, 6, <lb/>7, 8, 10, 12, 17, 18; tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±); IFN-Î³; granulocyte <lb/>Fig. 3 The signaling pathways for the production and function of IFN-I after SARS-CoV-2 infection. After infection, the genomic ssRNAs and <lb/>replicative dsRNA intermediates of SARS-CoV-2 are recognized by endosomal toll-like receptors TLR3, 7, 8, and cytosolic RNA sensors, RIG-1/ <lb/>MDA5; next, downstream transcription factors including NF-ÎºB and IRF3/7 are activated to induce the production of pro-inflammatory <lb/>cytokines and IFN-I. IFN-I can activate the JAK1/TYK2-STAT1/2 pathway, promoting the formation of the STAT1/2/IRF9 complex and initiating <lb/>the transcription of ISGs to produce anti-virus mediators, and it can also nonconventionally activate inflammatory pathways such as NF-ÎºB <lb/>and MAPK pathways to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and paradoxical hyperinflammation in COVID-19 <lb/></body>

			<body>colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); granulocyte-macrophage colony-<lb/>stimulating factor (GM-CSF); and monocyte chemoattractant <lb/>protein-1 (MCP-1). 26,33,60,81-86 Reports of hemophagocytosis and <lb/>clinical benefits from cytokine-targeted therapies in severe COVID-<lb/>19 patients further confirmed the existence and pathogenesis of <lb/>COVID-CS. 87,88 Existing evidence has characterized and distinguished <lb/>COVID-CS from CS in variable conditions such as HLH induced by <lb/>specific viral infections, 89 macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) <lb/>occurring after autoimmune disorders, 90 and cytokine release <lb/>syndrome (CRS) caused by CAR T cell therapy 23 in several aspects. <lb/>First, COVID-CS involves more inflammatory cytokines than other CS <lb/>conditions, thereby providing an explanation for the aggressive <lb/>nature of COVID-19. Second, lymphopenia, although relatively less <lb/>frequent in other CS, was often observed in patients with COVID-<lb/>CS, 88 suggesting that COVID-CS may be mainly attributed to innate <lb/>-rather than adaptive immune cells. Finally, compared with <lb/>bacterial infection-induced CS (e.g., sepsis), the treatment of <lb/>COVID-CS is more challenging, because blocking inflammatory <lb/>cytokine function without effective anti-viral drug support may <lb/>exacerbate the infection. <lb/>The initiation of COVID-CS induction during infection and the <lb/>predominant causative cytokine in COVID-19 immunopathology <lb/>remain largely unknown. Despite the lack of definite pathogen-<lb/>associated molecule pattern (PAMP) of SARS-CoV-2, in analogy <lb/>with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it can be speculated that upon <lb/>cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 via its ACE2 receptor, viral genomic <lb/>single-stranded RNA or other RNA compositions (double-stranded <lb/>RNA) as PAMPs can be sensed by the related PRRs, including TLRs <lb/>and RLRs in host cells. The downstream transcription factors IRF3/ <lb/>7 and NF-ÎºB are activated following PAMP recognition to induce <lb/>the production of IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respec-<lb/>tively. 91-93 However, as mentioned above, the protective IFN-I <lb/>response is quickly and selectively abrogated by SARS-CoV-2 via <lb/>different mechanisms. This is accompanied by an overwhelming <lb/>production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the context of <lb/>COVID-19, which not only impairs viral clearance but also <lb/>promotes paradoxical hyperinflammation including CS. Therefore, <lb/>from the immunology perspective, COVID-CS may be an <lb/>unfortunate event whereby the intended host immune response <lb/>combating the SARS-CoV-2 has lost control and transformed into <lb/>an inflammatory type. 15 <lb/>In SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus infects the respiratory <lb/>epithelial tissue and activates local innate immune cells to release <lb/>inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-Î±, and <lb/>other chemokines. These inflammatory cytokines and chemokines <lb/>then recruit more innate immune cells (monocytes, macrophages, <lb/>neutrophils, DCs, and NK cells) and activate adaptive immune cells <lb/>(CD4 + and CD8 + T cells) from the peripheral tissues to produce <lb/>sustained inflammatory cytokines like IL-2, IFN-Î³, and TNF-Î±, which <lb/>induce myelopoiesis and emergency granulopoiesis that further <lb/>aggravate lung and epithelial damage (Fig. 4). In addition, <lb/>overproduction of systemic cytokines, particularly IL-2, IFN-Î³, <lb/>GM-CSF, and TNF-Î±, triggers macrophage activation (i.e., MAS) and <lb/>erythro-phagocytosis (i.e., HLH), resulting in anemia, 94,95 as well as <lb/>causes perturbation of coagulation and vascular hemostasis, <lb/>resulting in capillary leak syndrome, thrombosis, 96 and DIC. These <lb/>events together lead to ARDS, multiorgan failure, and death <lb/>(Fig. 4). 15 Of note, the host immunoregulatory system is usually <lb/>capable of retaining and fine-tuning the protective inflammation <lb/>to an appropriate level. Regulatory cells such as Tregs 97,98 can <lb/>produce regulatory cytokines like IL-10 and tumor growth factor-Î² <lb/>to antagonize overactivated immune responses. 99,100 However, <lb/>aggressive inflammatory conditions such as CS cannot be calmed <lb/>by the regulatory system&apos;s natural ability. <lb/>Although the immunological and pathological understanding of <lb/>COVID-CS has provided valuable information regarding the <lb/>development of diagnosis and treatment strategies, detailed <lb/>guidelines are still lacking. Developing scoring systems such as <lb/>Fig. 4 The immunopathological mechanisms of COVID-CS. SARS-CoV-2 infects the epithelial cells or immune cells, causing tissue damage and <lb/>release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNFÎ±) by epithelial cells and immune cells. These inflammatory cytokines then <lb/>recruit innate immune cells (monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, DCs, and NK cells) and activate adaptive immune cells (CD4 + T cells and <lb/>CD8 + T cells) to induce the occurrence of myelopoiesis and emergency granulopoiesis, as well as the production of sustained and excessive <lb/>circulating cytokines that can further aggravate epithelial damage. In addition, overproduction of systemic cytokines triggers macrophage <lb/>activation (i.e., MAS) and erythro-phagocytosis (i.e., HLH), resulting in anemia and gives rise to perturbation of vascular hemostasis, resulting in <lb/>capillary leak syndrome, thrombosis, and DIC.

In another study, the authors <lb/>proposed that a diagnostic criterion including peripheral blood <lb/>oxygen saturation to the fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO 2 /FiO 2 ), <lb/>CRP, ferritin, cytokines/chemokines, and neutrophil/lymphocyte <lb/>ratio may have a strong diagnostic power for COVID-CS. 102 Mehta <lb/>et al. 13 proposed that prospective screening for hyperinflamma-<lb/>tion using laboratory assays and the HScore should be performed <lb/>in all severely ill COVID-19 patients to identify COVID-CS. Despite <lb/>the requirement for further validation, these criteria indeed <lb/>provide constructive suggestions for the development of officially <lb/>recognized guidelines for COVID-CS. <lb/>COVID-CS is a complicated and dynamic inflammatory process <lb/>caused by a group of cytokines from initiation, immune cell <lb/>hyperactivation, to organ dysfunction. The development of <lb/>precise therapeutic intervention in appropriate time is required <lb/>to effectively control COVID-CS. In principle, the treatment <lb/>strategy is to control ongoing inflammatory response by <lb/>specifically or nonspecifically targeting inflammatory cytokines <lb/>or related signaling pathways and to resume the host <lb/>immunoregulatory system. Herein, we discuss the role of the <lb/>key cytokines and associated signal pathways involved in <lb/>COVID-CS (Fig. 5). <lb/>IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling. A retrospective, multicenter study <lb/>including 150 patients from Wuhan, China showed significantly <lb/>elevated levels of IL-6 in severe COVID-19 cases. 103 A study from <lb/>Germany showed that IL-6 &gt;80 pg/mL in combination with CRP <lb/>&gt;97 mg/L presented a relatively high specificity and sensitivity to <lb/>predict respiratory failure. 104 In addition, other studies have also <lb/>shown the remarkably increased serum levels of IL-6 in patients <lb/>with severe COVID-19. 68,105,106 <lb/>IL-6, first produced by monocytes, macrophages, and DCs, <lb/>serves as a prominent activator of the JAK/STAT3 pathway in the <lb/>context of inflammation. Recent studies have determined that the <lb/>IL-6-JAK-STAT3 axis is closely related to the severity of COVID-<lb/>19, 107,108 and the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 were higher in <lb/>different subsets of leukocytes in COVID-19 patients than in <lb/>healthy controls. 109 IL-6 deploys two signaling pathways-classic <lb/>cis-signaling and trans-signaling-to trigger the activation of <lb/>downstream JAK/STAT3 signaling through the membrane-bound <lb/>(mIL-6R) and soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R), respectively. 110 In cis-<lb/>signaling, IL-6 binds to mIL-6Rs that are restrictedly expressed on <lb/>immune cells, forming an IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex to activate <lb/>downstream JAK/STAT3, Akt/mTOR, and MAPK signaling. This <lb/>exerts pleiotropic effects on immune cells, which are manifested <lb/>as promoted differentiation of T-helper type 17 (Th17), CD8 + T, <lb/>and B cells; increased migration of neutrophils; and reduced <lb/>development of Tregs. 111,112 These, in turn, induce increased <lb/>secretion of IL-6 and aggravate inflammation. In trans-signaling, <lb/>circulating IL-6 binds to sIL-6Rs to form a complex, then binds with <lb/>the gp130 dimer that is expressed on almost all cell types. The <lb/>resultant activation of the JAK-STAT3 signaling occurs in cells with <lb/>absent expression of mIL-6R, such as endothelial cells and vascular <lb/>smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The overwhelming activation of the <lb/>IL-6-IL-6R-JAK-STAT3 pathway triggers the secretion of various <lb/>mediators, such as IL-6 itself, IL-8, MCP-1, and vascular endothelial <lb/>growth factor (VEGF), and reduces the expression of E-cadherin <lb/>Fig. 5 Inflammatory signaling cascades activated in COVID-CS. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells and is sensed by toll-like receptors (TLRs)3, 7, <lb/>8; RIG-I-like receptor, RIG-I or MDA5; and NOD-like receptor, NLRP3, that can also be directly activated by viral proteins or ROS released by <lb/>apoptotic or inflamed cells. The downstream transcription factors IRF3/7 are activated to induce the production of IFN-I and related <lb/>paradoxical hyperinflammation; NF-ÎºB is activated to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; and NLRP3 inflammasome is <lb/>activated to induce the production of mature IL-1Î² and IL-18. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-2, TNF-Î±, and IFN-Î³ in turn activate <lb/>the JAK-STAT or NF-ÎºB signaling via binding to their receptors expressed on immune cells to induce more production of pro-inflammatory <lb/>genes, forming a positive feedback to trigger the threshold of CS. Conversely, regulatory cytokines like IL-10 are compensatorily produced to <lb/>antagonize immune hyperactivity <lb/></body>

			<body>expressed on endothelial cells. 113 Several studies have shown that <lb/>MCP-1 can facilitate the formation of atherogenesis, 114 production <lb/>of adhesion molecules, 115,116 and proliferation and migration of <lb/>VSMCs, 117 which partly explains the occurrence of cardiovascular <lb/>symptoms observed in COVID-CS. In addition, increased VEGF and <lb/>decreased E-cadherin can lead to vascular permeability and <lb/>leakage and accelerate the presence of hypotension and <lb/>pulmonary dysfunction in COVID-CS. 87 Moreover, IL-6 can <lb/>promote the secretion of various acute-phase proteins such as <lb/>CRP, hepcidin, fibrinogen, thrombopoietin, complement C3, and <lb/>ferritin in hepatocytes. 118,119 Collectively, IL-6 contributes to both <lb/>immune cell hyperactivation and target organ dysfunction in CS. <lb/>Evidence has suggested that the production of IL-6 can be <lb/>induced by angiotensin II in inflamed vessels. The underlying <lb/>mechanism is that angiotensin II binds to angiotensin II type 1 <lb/>(AT1) receptor and then activates JAK/STAT signaling to induce IL-<lb/>6 production. 120,121 Interestingly, existing studies have shown that <lb/>SARS-CoV may promote the expression of angiotensin II by <lb/>downregulating ACE2, 122,123 which potentially leads to the <lb/>possibility that SARS-CoV-2 enhances IL-6 production via the <lb/>angiotensin II/AT1 receptor/JAK/STAT axis, and the positive pro-<lb/>inflammatory feedback of IL-6/JAK/STAT ultimately drives clinical <lb/>signatures of COVID-19, especially COVID-CS. 124 <lb/>IFN-Î³/JAK/STAT signaling. IFN-Î³, mainly produced by macro-<lb/>phages, T cells, and NK cells, participates in immunological <lb/>processes such as inflammation. It is a dominating driver of <lb/>macrophage, NK, and T cell activation, and exerts a predominant <lb/>effect on protective immunity against bacterial and viral infections <lb/>through the activation of JAK1/JAK2 complex and downstream <lb/>STAT1-IFN-Î³-activated site (GAS) cascades. 125-127 <lb/>Evidence has shown that IFN-Î³ is highly involved in various CS-<lb/>related disorders, 128 as illustrated by its pathological role in <lb/>primary HLH, a syndrome of failure to eliminate pathogens owing <lb/>to impaired NK cell activity. In such cases, despite excessive T cell <lb/>activation and large quantities of IFN-Î³ production, the increased <lb/>IFN-Î³ levels fail to combat pathogens and instead cause <lb/>immunopathology because of defective NK activity. 129 Whether <lb/>IFN-Î³ plays a specific role in COVID-CS is still unknown; however, <lb/>considering its role in promoting immune cell activation, we can <lb/>speculate that it contributes substantially to COVID-CS. <lb/>Numerous studies have reported elevated levels of IFN-Î³ in <lb/>patients with COVID-19. 9,130,131 Of note, one study showed that <lb/>IFN-Î³ produced by CD4 + T cells was decreased in patients with <lb/>severe disease compared to those with moderate disease, which <lb/>could be explained by the reduced numbers and functional <lb/>exhaustion of T cells in severe COVID-19, 132 as described-above. <lb/>Therefore, this study suggested that elevated levels of IFN-Î³ in <lb/>COVID-19 are produced mainly by macrophages, not T cells. <lb/>TNFÎ±/NF-ÎºB signaling. TNFÎ± is a well-known pro-inflammatory <lb/>cytokine and is closely associated with many infectious, auto-<lb/>immune diseases, and cancer, and is primarily produced by <lb/>monocytes, macrophages, and T cells. 133,134 NF-ÎºB plays an <lb/>evolutionarily conserved role in the immune system, 135,136 espe-<lb/>cially in regulating the expression of various vital cytokines involved <lb/>in inflammation. 137 TNFÎ±, as an initial driver of NF-ÎºB activation, can <lb/>activate the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway to induce the expression of <lb/>several pro-inflammatory and antiapoptotic genes through its <lb/>receptor TNFR1 and a series of intermediate adapters. 138-140 In turn, <lb/>NF-ÎºB can induce TNFÎ± expression in the context of inflammation, <lb/>such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. 141 Therefore, TNFÎ±/NF-<lb/>ÎºB signaling may play pathological roles in the stage of initiation <lb/>and immune cell hyperactivation in CS by inducing apoptosis of <lb/>epithelial cells to drive the epithelium-immune cell interplay and <lb/>augmenting systemic inflammation. <lb/>Previous studies have found that excessive TNFÎ± represented a <lb/>poor prognosis in SARS-CoV and MERS cases, 142-145 and inhibition <lb/>of NF-ÎºB improved pulmonary symptoms in SARS-CoV-infected <lb/>mice. 146 However, the role of TNFÎ± in COVID-19 is, so far, still not <lb/>entirely clear. Recent studies have reported elevated serum levels of <lb/>TNFÎ± in severe COVID-19 cases. 9,13,24,81 In addition, a clinical trial <lb/>from Wuhan, China, including 522 patients and 40 healthy controls <lb/>showed that the concentration of TNFÎ± was negatively correlated <lb/>with T cell counts in COVID-19 patients. 27 In contrast, a clinical trial <lb/>from Chongqing, China, including 102 mild and 21 severe cases <lb/>showed that TNFÎ± levels were within the normal values in almost all <lb/>COVID-19 patients (121/123). 147 Thus, further research is urgently <lb/>required to better understand the role of TNFÎ± in COVID-CS. <lb/>Although a recent report suggested that inhibition of the TNFÎ±-NF-<lb/>ÎºB pathway may have protective effects in COVID-19, 124 caution <lb/>should be applied based on two aspects: (1) as mentioned above, <lb/>the roles of TNFÎ± in COVID-CS is still undefined; (2) blocking NF-ÎºB <lb/>nonspecifically may simultaneously impair its protective functions <lb/>in cellular homeostasis, as exemplified by a general suppression on <lb/>innate immunity. 148 <lb/>NLRP3/IL-1Î² signaling. IL-1Î² is perhaps the most well-studied <lb/>member of the IL-1 family because of its prominent role in <lb/>autoinflammatory diseases such as gout and chronic inflammatory <lb/>arthritis. 149-151 IL-1Î² is mainly secreted by macrophages via <lb/>apoptosis and pyroptosis and exerts positive effects on the <lb/>migration of immune cells to inflamed tissues; Th17 cell <lb/>differentiation; expression and release of various cytokines and <lb/>adhesion factors; and NF-ÎºB pathway activation to form a positive <lb/>feedback for its own production. 152,153 Upstream, the NLRP3 <lb/>protein forms a complex with apoptosis-associated speck-like <lb/>protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and <lb/>cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-1 (caspase-1), termed the <lb/>NLRP3 inflammasome, to cleave the inactive IL-1Î² precursor to the <lb/>mature form of IL-1Î². 154,155 Considering the positive roles of IL-1Î² <lb/>in activating initiative and sustained inflammation, 156 it was <lb/>postulated that NLRP3-IL-1Î² signaling might be involved in <lb/>COVID-CS. <lb/>Multiple indicators from previous evidence have suggested that <lb/>IL-1Î² may contribute to CS in coronavirus infections. 157-159 Zhang <lb/>et al. 160 reported the elevated levels of multiple cytokines <lb/>including IL-1Î² in COVID-19 cases with severe symptoms, which <lb/>were also associated with SARS, hypercoagulation, and DIC. <lb/>Consistently, Huang et al. 9 also showed high serum concentrations <lb/>of IL-1Î² in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, a previous study showed <lb/>that NLRP3 can be directly activated by viral proteins of SARS-CoV <lb/>such as ORF3a and ORF8b, 161,162 which were also found on the <lb/>genome of SARS-CoV-2, 163 suggesting a potentially similar effect <lb/>of direct activation of the NLRP3 by SARS-CoV-2 protein. The <lb/>potential roles of NLRP3 inflammasome in severe COVID-19 have <lb/>been discussed in relevant reviews. 164,165 Reactive oxygen species <lb/>(ROS) was reportedly an initiator of NLRP3 activation. 166-168 Thus, <lb/>it was proposed that excessive production of ROS resulting from <lb/>inflammation infiltration in severe COVID-19 may lead to NLRP3 <lb/>activation and IL-1Î² precursor cleavage, further aggravating <lb/>inflammation in COVID-CS. <lb/>IL-2/IL-2R/JAK/STAT5 signaling. IL-2 is mainly secreted by CD4 + <lb/>T cells and plays crucial roles in the expansion and differentiation <lb/>of CD4 + T, CD8 + T, NK, and other cells through the IL-<lb/>2R-JAK-STAT5 signaling pathway. 169,170 IL-2 can fine-tune <lb/>immune responses and maintain self-tolerance, 171 and its <lb/>deficiency accounts for the occurrence of autoimmune dis-<lb/>eases. 172 <lb/>Elevated levels of IL-2 have been reported in other types of <lb/>coronavirus infections. 173,174 Recent studies have also shown that <lb/>the concentrations of IL-2 or IL-2R were elevated in COVID-19 <lb/>patients, especially in those with severe illness. 9,13,24,132 However, <lb/>a clinical trial including 54 COVID-19 patients from Beijing, China, <lb/>reported a contradictory result. The authors found that compared <lb/></body>

			<body>with severe patients (n = 14), those with a critical illness (n = 6) <lb/>had remarkably reduced plasma levels of IL-2. Accordingly, IL-2RÎ± <lb/>levels were significantly decreased in the PBMCs of patients with a <lb/>severe and critical illness compared to common patients (n = 34) <lb/>or healthy controls. Furthermore, the levels of JAK1 and STAT5 <lb/>were significantly lower in all three groups than in normal <lb/>controls. Considering the supportive roles of IL-2 in the expansion <lb/>and differentiation of T cells, the authors speculated that the <lb/>presence of lymphopenia especially in severe COVID-19 may be <lb/>attributed to reduced levels of IL-2, IL-2R, JAK1, and STAT5. 175 In <lb/>additionally, CD4 + T cells are the primary source of IL-2, and the <lb/>reduced numbers of lymphocytes during the stage of CS after <lb/>COVID-19 infection can at least partly explain the reduced IL-2 <lb/>level and downregulation of IL-2 signaling. Future investigations <lb/>are required to confirm these findings in more patients. <lb/>IL-7/IL-7R signaling. IL-7/IL-7R signaling is essential for peripheral <lb/>homeostasis and the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of <lb/>T cells including CD4 + T, CD8 + T, naive T, and memory T cells. 176-<lb/>179 It is also indispensable for the development and maintenance <lb/>of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), formation of lymphoid structures, <lb/>and barrier defense. 180 <lb/>Recent reports have shown elevated levels of IL-7 in COVID-19 <lb/>patients, and these increases were related to disease sever-<lb/>ity. 9,13,147 However, the impact of enhanced levels of IL-7 in <lb/>COVID-19 is largely unknown. Considering the protective role of <lb/>IL-7, we can speculate that the increase of IL-7 may be a feedback <lb/>mechanism in response to the lymphopenia in patients with <lb/>severe/critical COVID-19. <lb/>IL-10 signaling. IL-10 is an important immunoregulatory cytokine <lb/>produced by a variety of immune cells including Th2 cells, Tregs, <lb/>CD8 + T cells, B cells, DCs, macrophages, and NK cells, and signals <lb/>through the IL-10R/JAK/STAT3 pathway. IL-10 exerts anti-<lb/>inflammatory functions by directly limiting the innate immune-<lb/>related functions of macrophages and DCs in an autocrine and <lb/>paracrine manner or indirectly via improving Treg development. In <lb/>addition, IL-10 can activate mast cells and strengthen the <lb/>functions of CD8 + T, B, and NK cells. 181 <lb/>A clinical trial including 102 COVID-19 patients and 45 controls <lb/>from Wuhan, China, showed that the serum IL-10 levels of patients <lb/>with a critical illness (n = 17) were significantly higher than those <lb/>of patients with moderate (n = 42) and severe (n = 43) illness; <lb/>further, the IL-10 levels were positively correlated with the <lb/>concentrations of serum CRP, indicating the potential of IL-10 as <lb/>an indicator of disease severity. 182 Huang et al. 9 also reported the <lb/>significantly high plasma levels of IL-10 in COVID-19 patients <lb/>admitted to the ICU compared to those who were not. In addition, <lb/>a follow-up clinical trial including 71 COVID-19 patients (53 mild <lb/>and 18 severe) from Beijing, China and 18 controls showed that <lb/>the production of IL-10 in the early stage was significantly <lb/>correlated with disease severity. 183 <lb/>It can be speculated that the excessive production of IL-10 is a <lb/>negative feedback mechanism to antagonize the hyperactivity of <lb/>the immune system. However, when faced with an overwhelming <lb/>secretion of inflammatory mediators and activation of pro-<lb/>inflammatory cells in COVID-CS, the fine-tune function of IL-10 is <lb/>rather inadequate. Thus, administration of IL-10 has been <lb/>recommended to treat ARDS in COVID-19. 184 However, a recent <lb/>report showed that IL-10 may be detrimental in the initiation <lb/>phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection by promoting T cell exhaustion. <lb/>The authors proposed that blocking IL-10 with a neutralizing <lb/>antibody in the initiation stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a <lb/>promising therapeutic approach. 185 <lb/>IL-12 signaling. IL-12, mainly produced by DCs, macrophages, <lb/>and B lymphocytes, 186 is a multifunctional immunoregulatory <lb/>factor that can promote proliferation of Th1 and Th17 cells; <lb/>improve the cytotoxicity of NK cells; and induce expression of IFN-<lb/>Î³ in Th1 cells, NK cells, DCs, and macrophages via a positive <lb/>feedback mechanism. 187,188 Thus, IL-12 plays an aggressive role in <lb/>CS by augmenting the activation of various immune cells. <lb/>Existing studies have reported that viral infections induce the <lb/>production of IL-12 to defend against infections. 189-191 For <lb/>instance, during influenza virus infection, IL-12 is endogenously <lb/>produced to induce the secretion of IFN-Î³ from Th1 and NK cells, <lb/>thereby inhibiting viral replication. 190 A previous study reported <lb/>elevated plasma levels of IL-12 in patients infected by SARS-<lb/>CoV. 192 However, Huang et al. 9 recently found that the plasma <lb/>levels of IL-12p70 showed no difference between COVID-19 <lb/>patients and healthy adults. Therefore, further research with large-<lb/>sized samples is urgently required to determine the alterations <lb/>and functions of IL-12 in COVID-19, especially COVID-CS. <lb/>IL-17 signaling. IL-17 (primarily IL-17A) is produced by Th17, <lb/>CD8 + T, and group 3 ILC (ILC3) and participates in many pro-<lb/>inflammatory processes and autoimmune diseases. 193-195 Target-<lb/>ing IL-17 is now regarded as a common strategy to reduce the <lb/>burden of several autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and <lb/>psoriatic arthritis. Nevertheless, the functions of this inflammatory <lb/>cytokine vary, from being protective against infections to having <lb/>detrimental pro-inflammatory effects, depending on the tissue <lb/>type and location (gut, lung, or skin) where it is being expressed <lb/>and its triggering factors. 196 <lb/>Increased levels of IL-17 were previously reported in SARS-CoV-<lb/>or MERS-CoV-infected patients. 197,198 In addition, IL-17 can <lb/>augment lung injury and decrease overall survival through <lb/>recruitment of neutrophils; stimulate the expression of pro-<lb/>inflammatory factors; and induce the expression of G-CSF to <lb/>prevent apoptosis in both ARDS and an LPS-induced acute lung <lb/>injury model. 199,200 Similarly, evidence has suggested that IL-17 <lb/>levels were elevated in COVID-19 patients, especially in those with <lb/>a severe and critical illness. 201 Asrani and Hassan 156 showed that <lb/>IL-17 plays crucial roles in the stages of immune cell hyperactiva-<lb/>tion and target organ dysfunction in COVID-CS by promoting the <lb/>recruitment of neutrophils and producing symptoms such as <lb/>fever, matrix damage, tissue remodeling, and inflammatory <lb/>infiltration. <lb/>Despite multiple evidence suggesting the potential of IL-17 as <lb/>an intervention target for COVID-CS, studies have shown that the <lb/>levels of IL-17 were within normal ranges in 102 and 21 patients <lb/>with mild and severe COVID-19, respectively. 147 Therefore, more <lb/>clinical trials and fundamental research are required for further <lb/>clarification. <lb/>GM-CSF signaling. GM-CSF is produced by endothelial, epithelial, <lb/>hematopoietic, and other cell types. 202 Under physiological <lb/>conditions, low levels of GM-CSF can regulate the homeostasis <lb/>of alveolar macrophages to maintain their antimicrobial func-<lb/>tions. 203,204 Under hyperinflammatory conditions such as CS, GM-<lb/>CSF drives emergency myelopoiesis and recruits myeloid cells to <lb/>the inflammatory sites to perpetuate inflammatory reactions. 205 <lb/>Increased levels of GM-CSF have been observed in SARS, 206 <lb/>ARDS, 207 and CRS. 208 A recent study also reported elevated GM-<lb/>CSF levels in both severe and mild COVID-19. 9 <lb/>Given the role of GM-CSF in maintaining antimicrobial functions <lb/>of alveolar macrophages, administration of GM-CSF to patients <lb/>with early-stage COVID-19 may strengthen the alveolar wall and <lb/>enhance viral clearance. 209 In contrast, the blockade of GM-CSF <lb/>signaling may achieve clinical benefits in COVID-CS. <lb/>CYTOKINE-BASED INTERVENTIONS <lb/>The current treatment for CS is mainly based on traditional anti-<lb/>inflammatory drugs such as the administration of corticosteroids, <lb/>chloroquine, and colchicines. 210,211 Recently, biologics like <lb/></body>

			<body>recombinant cytokines; monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, IL-1Î², <lb/>TNF-Î±, and IFN-Î³; and signaling pathway inhibitors are also <lb/>available or in the pipeline for production. In this and the next <lb/>section, we aim to discuss the key biologics that are currently or <lb/>potentially applied to treat CS (Fig. 6). <lb/>IFN-I <lb/>Administration of IFN-I has previously been investigated for the <lb/>treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Generally, it was found to <lb/>be relatively effective in vitro and in some animal models, 212 <lb/>although human studies were inconclusive. 213 <lb/>The research team at the University of Texas Medical Branch, <lb/>USA, showed that low concentrations of IFN-Î± and IFN-Î² <lb/>effectively reduced virus titer and inhibited viral replication in <lb/>Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner, and they also found that <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than SARS-CoV to IFN-I in vitro. 214 An <lb/>uncontrolled, exploratory study from Tongji Medical College, <lb/>Wuhan, China, showed that administration of IFN-Î±2b alone or in <lb/>combination with arbidol remarkably accelerated virus clearance <lb/>as well as the recovery of IL-6 and CRP to normal levels in COVID-<lb/>19 patients. 215 A randomized, multicenter, prospective, phase 2 <lb/>clinical trial conducted at the University of Hong Kong showed <lb/>that compared with the control group (lopinavir/ritonavir), COVID-<lb/>19 patients in the triple group (IFNÎ²-1b plus lopinavir/ritonavir + <lb/>ribavirin) exhibited significantly alleviated symptoms; shortened <lb/>virus shedding and hospital stay; and improved inflammatory <lb/>conditions (NCT04276688). 216 A prospective study including 2944 <lb/>healthy medical staff in the epidemic areas from Taihe Hospital in <lb/>Shiyan City, Hubei, China, showed that the incidence rate of <lb/>COVID-19 was zero in both the low-risk group (n = 2415) and the <lb/>high-risk group (n = 529) after treatment with recombinant IFN-Î± <lb/>nose drops for 30 days (NCT04320238), 217 indicating the <lb/>preventive roles of recombinant IFN-Î± in COVID-19. A trial <lb/>comparing the clinical efficacy of subcutaneous IFN-Î²1a plus <lb/>lopinavir/ritonavir with lopinavir/ritonavir alone; hydroxychloro-<lb/>quine; and remdesivir in COVID-19 is still ongoing (NCT04315948). <lb/>Collectively, these studies suggested that IFN-I can inhibit SARS-<lb/>CoV-2 infection and potential COVID-CS. <lb/>Another type of interferon-IFN-III-may also have a clinical <lb/>benefit in COVID-19 treatment. Dinnon et al. 218 confirmed the <lb/>anti-viral effect of pegylated IFN-Î»1a in both SARS-CoV-2-infected <lb/>human airway epithelial cells and mouse models. Some studies <lb/>have determined that MDA5 plays a leading role in activating IFN-<lb/>I/III response to defend against SARS-CoV-2 in human epithelial <lb/>cells, 219-221 which may open a new avenue for enhancing IFN <lb/>response in COVID-19. In addition, several clinical trials evaluating <lb/>the clinical efficacy of IFN-Î» are under investigation (NCT04343976, <lb/>NCT04331899). <lb/>IL-7 <lb/>The supportive role of IL-7 in lymphocyte survival and expansion <lb/>provides clinical implications for the recovery of function of <lb/>lymphocytes in severe/critical COVID-19. <lb/>A case report from Hospices Civils de Lyon, France, showed that <lb/>a period of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) treatment remarkably <lb/>improved the immune function in a 74-year-old ICU patient with <lb/>severe COVID-19, which manifested as elevated lymphocyte count <lb/>and mHLA-DR expression. In this case, IL-7 was administered quite <lb/>late, on day 24 of admission. Thus, the authors prospectively <lb/>proposed that earlier administration of IL-7 may have indicated <lb/>better clinical outcomes. 222 In a case series from St. Luc University <lb/>Hospital, Brussels, Belgium, the authors showed that patients in <lb/>the IL-7 treatment group seemed to have higher levels of <lb/>lymphocyte counts than those in the control group, without <lb/>aggravated inflammation and pulmonary injury. 223 Unfortunately, <lb/>the absence of detailed phenotypic or functional studies on <lb/>lymphocytes weakens the reliability of these studies. A multi-<lb/>center, double-blind clinical trial in a UK-based cohort is currently <lb/>evaluating whether the administration of CYT107 (a commercial <lb/>product of rhIL-7) can result in clinical improvement of patients <lb/>with severe COVID-19 through immune reconstitution <lb/>(NCT04379076). Clark et al. 224 proposed that administration of <lb/>Fig. 6 The potential inhibitors and therapies to counteract COVID-CS. A variety of inhibitors or drugs have been applied or are under <lb/>consideration to treat COVID-CS, including those targeting a single pro-inflammatory cytokine or its receptor and related signal pathway. In <lb/>addition, several treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, traditional Chinese medicine, and CDK7 inhibitor may have <lb/>the potential to counteract multiple cytokines and pathways involved in COVID-CS.

			<body>IL-7 in combination with dexamethasone may be an optimal <lb/>treatment for severe COVID-19. The underlying mechanism is that <lb/>dexamethasone enhances IL-7 activity by upregulating its receptor <lb/>IL-7RÎ±, which can also be used to explain the most effective <lb/>properties of dexamethasone in the more severe stage of the <lb/>disease. 225,226 <lb/>These studies indicate that appropriate administration of IL-7 <lb/>alone or in combination with other agents should be considered <lb/>as early as possible for critical COVID-19 patients with severe <lb/>lymphopenia. <lb/>BLOCKADE OF CYTOKINES <lb/>Blockade of IL-6 <lb/>As mentioned above, IL-6 signaling is a leading inducer of <lb/>COVID-CS. Currently, several drugs targeting IL-6 signaling such <lb/>as IL-6 inhibitors (siltuximab, clazakizumab, sirukumab, olokizu-<lb/>mab) and IL-6R inhibitors (tocilizumab, sarilumab, levilimab) are <lb/>available. 227-229 <lb/>A retrospective clinical trial from Anhui, China, including 21 <lb/>COVID-19 patients with severe or critical illness showed that five <lb/>days of tocilizumab therapy immediately improved the clinical <lb/>outcomes in most patients, manifested as decreased oxygen <lb/>requirements, serum CRP concentrations, and hospital stays, as <lb/>well as the rapid recovery of lymphocyte percentage. 230 Another <lb/>multicenter cohort study including 3924 COVID-19 patients in <lb/>the ICU across 68 hospitals in the United States showed that the <lb/>risk of mortality was lower in 433 patients who received <lb/>tocilizumab treatment immediately after ICU admission than in <lb/>those who did not receive early tocilizumab intervention. 231 In <lb/>addition, numerous reports evaluating the administration of <lb/>tocilizumab for severe COVID-19 have also been pub-<lb/>lished, 106,232-247 and a total of 75 clinical trials are currently <lb/>registered in ClinicalTrials. gov. <lb/>An open-label study from Italy including 56 patients with severe <lb/>COVID-19 showed that after 28 days of follow-up, sarilumab <lb/>treatment (n = 28) appeared to promote the recovery of patients <lb/>with mild lung consolidation (&lt;17%) at baseline. 248 Another <lb/>retrospective, single-center, clinical trial from Italy including 15 <lb/>COVID-19 patients showed that sarilumab treatment improved the <lb/>clinical symptoms and reduced serum CRP levels in most patients <lb/>(n = 10). 249 Currently, a total of 17 clinical trials on sarilumab are <lb/>registered in ClinicalTrials.gov for the treatment of COVID-19. <lb/>A randomized, phase 3, clinical trial evaluating the administra-<lb/>tion of levilimab in patients with severe COVID-19 has been <lb/>completed, but the results have not yet been published <lb/>(NCT04397562). <lb/>An observational, controlled cohort study from Italy including <lb/>30 patients requiring ventilator support showed that the 30-day <lb/>mortality was significantly reduced in those receiving siltuximab <lb/>plus optimal supportive care compared with the control patients <lb/>who received only optimal supportive care; ~50% of patients <lb/>receiving siltuximab treatment were finally discharged <lb/>(NCT04322188). 250 Three other clinical trials evaluating the efficacy <lb/>and safety of siltuximab in severe COVID-19 are underway <lb/>(NCT04329650, NCT04330638, NCT04486521). <lb/>In general, published clinical trials showed positive results with <lb/>respect to some common IL-6 or IL-6R antagonists for the <lb/>treatment of COVID-CS. Several clinical trials of other IL-6 or IL-6R <lb/>antagonists including clazakizumab (NCT04381052, NCT04494724, <lb/>NCT04343989, NCT04363502, NCT04348500, NCT04659772); <lb/>sirukumab (NCT04380961); and olokizumab (NCT04380519, <lb/>NCT04452474) have been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov to <lb/>investigate their therapeutic potential in COVID-CS. <lb/>Blockade of IL-1Î² <lb/>Considering the pathological role of IL-1Î² signaling in CS, several <lb/>drugs targeting IL-1Î² signaling, including IL-1Î² antagonist <lb/>canakinumab and IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, may offer <lb/>clinical benefits in the treatment of COVID-19, particularly in CS. <lb/>A retrospective, three-center, clinical trial from France including 22 <lb/>patients with severe/critical COVID-19 showed that after &gt;8 days of <lb/>treatment, patients in the anakinra group (n = 12) presented <lb/>improved clinical conditions as well as decreased mechanical <lb/>ventilation requirements and serum CRP concentrations, as com-<lb/>pared with the control group (n = 10) (INDS, MR4115050520). 251 A <lb/>prospective, cohort study from the Netherlands showed that several <lb/>clinical parameters including temperature; white blood cell count; <lb/>and levels of plasma ferritin, creatinine, procalcitonin, and bilirubin <lb/>were decreased after 28 days of anakinra treatment. 252 Several other <lb/>studies have also investigated the clinical effects of anakinra on <lb/>COVID-19. 253-261 A total of 35 clinical trials are currently registered in <lb/>ClinicalTrials.gov. <lb/>A retrospective study from Italy reported for the first time <lb/>that subcutaneous administration of 300 mg canakinumab <lb/>rapidly reduced systemic inflammation and improved oxygena-<lb/>tion in COVID-19 patients (n = 10) who presented hyperin-<lb/>flammation but did not require mechanical ventilation. 262 <lb/>Another single-center, cohort study from Italy enrolled 34 <lb/>non-ICU patients with mild or severe COVID-19, with 17 <lb/>receiving standard treatment and 17 receiving 300 mg of <lb/>subcutaneous canakinumab. The results showed that canaki-<lb/>numab treatment significantly increased the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <lb/>and reduced inflammatory indices. 263 These two studies <lb/>suggest that canakinumab treatment may have therapeutic <lb/>potentials in non-ICU patients with mild or severe COVID-19. <lb/>Several other reports have also evaluated the administration of <lb/>canakinumab in COVID-19, 264-266 and six clinical trials are <lb/>currently registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04348448, <lb/>NCT04476706, NCT04362813, NCT04365153, NCT04510493, <lb/>NCT04278404). <lb/>Blockade of IFN-Î³ <lb/>Emapalumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IFN-Î³, has been <lb/>approved to treat primary HLH, a condition with elevated serum <lb/>levels of IFN-Î³. 267 Considering the contribution of IFN-Î³ to CS as <lb/>mentioned above, emapalumab may be effective in the treatment <lb/>of COVID-CS. <lb/>A randomized, multicenter, clinical trial from Italy was registered <lb/>to investigate the efficacy of emapalumab treatment in combina-<lb/>tion with anakinra to alleviate hyperinflammation and improve <lb/>respiratory conditions (NCT04324021). Unfortunately, this trial is <lb/>now terminated and no further data are currently available. <lb/>Therefore, other randomized, controlled clinical trials are urgently <lb/>required to address these issues. <lb/>Blockade of TNFÎ± <lb/>Recent studies have provided the theoretical and practical bases <lb/>to support TNFÎ± blockade as a potential strategy for excessive <lb/>cytokine release and hyperinflammation in COVID-19. 268-271 <lb/>Etanercept is a soluble TNFÎ± receptor fusion protein that has <lb/>been used to treat toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), a condition of <lb/>systemic hyperinflammation. Owing to the similarities in clinical <lb/>manifestations and pathological characteristics between COVID-19 <lb/>and TEN, Chen et al. 268 proposed the temporary use of etanercept <lb/>as a valuable approach to treat severe COVID-19. A case report <lb/>described that a 60-year-old man who received subcutaneous <lb/>etanercept treatment for spondyloarthritis prior to SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>infection presented no signs of respiratory failure and progressive <lb/>deterioration and showed rapid recovery from COVID-19. 269 <lb/>Infliximab is another clinically approved TNFÎ± blocker. A total of <lb/>four clinical trials of infliximab evaluating its therapeutic potential <lb/>in COVID-19 are currently underway (NCT04425538, NCT04734678, <lb/>NCT04593940, NCT04344249). Adalimumab is a monoclonal <lb/>antibody targeting TNFÎ± and is currently undergoing evaluation <lb/>in two clinical trials (ChiCTR2000030089, NCT04705844). <lb/></body>

			<body>Despite these promising results, we cannot exclude the <lb/>possibility of chance, and hence, randomized, controlled, pro-<lb/>spective clinical trials with a large sample size are urgently <lb/>required for further validation. <lb/>Blockade of IL-12/IL-23 <lb/>IL-12/23 inhibitors currently used in the clinic include risankizu-<lb/>mab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab (targeting IL-23p19), and usteki-<lb/>numab (targeting IL-12/IL-23p40) mainly for chronic inflammatory <lb/>and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and inflammatory <lb/>bowel disease. 272-276 A recent review proposed IL-12/IL-23 or IL-23 <lb/>inhibitors as potential interventional targets for the ongoing <lb/>COVID-19 pandemic. 277 <lb/>Several case reports have described the clinical efficacy of IL-12/ <lb/>IL-23 inhibitors including ustekinumab, guselkumab, risankizumab, <lb/>and risankizumab in COVID-19 patients with psoriasis. 278-282 The <lb/>reliability of case reports is relatively weak, which is why <lb/>randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trials are so important. <lb/>A multicenter, randomized, clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate <lb/>the efficacy of risankizumab alone or risankizumab in combination <lb/>with remdesivir in COVID-19 (NCT04583956). <lb/>Blockade of IL-17A <lb/>Several review articles have proposed targeting IL-17A signaling as <lb/>an intervening measure for patients with COVID-CS. 196,283-289 <lb/>Case reports from Italy have shown that patients with a history <lb/>of psoriasis and previous treatment with IL-17A antagonists <lb/>including secukinumab and ixekizumab showed relatively mild <lb/>COVID-19 symptoms or were even asymptomatic. 290-292 A retro-<lb/>spective, observational, multicenter clinical trial from Italy contain-<lb/>ing 5206 patients with psoriasis who have been prescribed <lb/>medications including IL-17 inhibitors showed that only four <lb/>patients were hospitalized for COVID-19, and no deaths <lb/>occurred, 293 indicating the protective role of IL-17A inhibitors in <lb/>COVID-CS and ARDS. However, using the general Italian popula-<lb/>tion as the control group reduces the degree of standardization <lb/>and reliability of this trial. The absence of standard clinical or <lb/>experimental diagnosis for COVID-19 is another limitation. In <lb/>addition, other prospective, randomized, clinical trials evaluating <lb/>the administration of ixekizumab (NCT04724629) and secukinu-<lb/>mab (NCT04403243) in COVID-19 are also underway. In addition, <lb/>many researchers have proposed that simultaneously targeting IL-<lb/>17A signaling and synergic IL-6 signaling may offer more clinical <lb/>benefit for COVID-19 patients, particularly for those who <lb/>experience CS. 283,286 <lb/>Blockade of GM-CSF <lb/>Several studies have reported the protective roles of GM-CSF in <lb/>the early stage of infection, 294-296 and numerous clinical trials of <lb/>human recombinant GM-CSF including sargramostim and mol-<lb/>gramostim have been registered for the treatment of COVID-19; <lb/>however, as mentioned above, GM-CSF indeed exerts a patholo-<lb/>gical function in the phase of CS, implying that blocking GM-CSF <lb/>signaling may achieve clinical benefits in COVID-CS. <lb/>Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody against GM-CSF-RÎ±. 297 <lb/>A prospective cohort study from Italy including 39 patients with <lb/>severe COVID-19 showed that patients in the mavrilimumab group <lb/>(n = 13) showed earlier improvement, lesser progression to <lb/>mechanical ventilation, and faster fever resolution than those in <lb/>the control group (n = 26). 298 In addition, several clinical trials <lb/>evaluating the administration of mavrilimumab in severe COVID-<lb/>19 have been registered (NCT04447469, NCT04463004, <lb/>NCT04492514, NCT04399980, NCT04397497). <lb/>Lenzilumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody against <lb/>human GM-CSF. A case-cohort study including 39 patients with <lb/>severe COVID-19 from the USA reported that compared to the <lb/>control group (n = 27), patients who received intravenous <lb/>treatment with lenzilumab (n = 12) exhibited significantly rapid <lb/>clinical improvement; reduced progression to ARDS; and <lb/>decreased inflammatory markers and inflammatory myeloid <lb/>cells. 299 In addition, several clinical trials for lenzilumab have <lb/>been registered for the treatment of severe COVID-19 <lb/>(NCT04351152, NCT04583969, NCT04534725). <lb/>These clinical trials showed that blockade of GM-CSF signaling <lb/>indeed improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-CS. <lb/>Moreover, several other GM-CSF inhibitors such as gimsilumab, <lb/>otilimab, and TJ003234 are undergoing clinical evaluation as <lb/>potential COVID-19 therapy (NCT04351243, NCT04376684, <lb/>NCT04341116, respectively). <lb/>BLOCKADE OF SIGNALING PATHWAYS <lb/>Blockade of JAK/STAT signaling <lb/>The JAK/STAT pathway lies downstream of various cytokines <lb/>involved in the CS. Thus, several studies have proposed that the <lb/>JAK/STAT signaling inhibition may be a valuable preventive or <lb/>therapeutic option for COVID-CS. 126,300-305 The clinical efficacy of <lb/>various JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) such as tofacitinib targeting JAK1 <lb/>and JAK3 306,307 as well as baricitinib and ruxolitinib, both targeting <lb/>JAK1 and JAK2, 308-310 are currently under investigation in clinical <lb/>trials in the context of COVID-19. <lb/>Hoang et al. 311 found that baricitinib treatment significantly <lb/>improved the inflammatory condition in SARS-CoV-2-infected <lb/>rhesus macaque, as manifested by reduced inflammatory cell <lb/>infiltration and neutrophil recruitment; limited lung pathology; <lb/>and suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in lung <lb/>macrophages. Baricitinib has also been evaluated in a series of <lb/>clinical trials. An observational, longitudinal trial including 76 <lb/>COVID-19 patients showed that compared with the control group <lb/>(n = 56), patients in the baricitinib group (n = 20) presented <lb/>remarkably reduced serum levels of IL-6, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î±; <lb/>accelerated recovery of blood T and B cell counts; increased <lb/>production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; and progressively <lb/>increased PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (NCT04438629). 109 Another observa-<lb/>tional cohort study from Spain showed that baricitinib improved <lb/>lung function in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 <lb/>receiving corticosteroid treatment. 312 Interestingly, existing stu-<lb/>dies showed that besides the acknowledged inhibitory effects on <lb/>CS, baricitinib can also dampen ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>endocytosis by inhibiting AP2-associated protein kinase 1 and <lb/>cyclin G-associated kinase, 313,314 which serves as another mechan-<lb/>ism of its action in COVID-19. Moreover, several other reports have <lb/>also been published, 313,315-322 and numerous clinical trials of <lb/>baricitinib are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov to evaluate its clinical <lb/>effects in severe COVID-19. <lb/>Several studies have shown that ruxolitinib may also be <lb/>effective in the treatment of severe/critical COVID-19. 323-326 In a <lb/>prospective, multicenter, single-blind, phase 2 clinical trial <lb/>including 41 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China, compared <lb/>with patients in the placebo group (n = 21), those in the <lb/>ruxolitinib group (n = 20) exhibited remarkably reduced levels of <lb/>seven cytokines, as well as a faster rate of clinical improvement <lb/>and lymphocyte-count recovery. 325 In addition, several other <lb/>clinical trials for ruxolitinib evaluation and six clinical trials that <lb/>are evaluating the administration of tofacitinib in COVID-19 <lb/>patients have been registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT04412252, <lb/>NCT04415151, NCT04750317, NCT04469114, NCT04390061, <lb/>NCT04332042). <lb/>Despite these promising clinical data, JAKinibs should be used <lb/>with caution because of their side effects, based on the following <lb/>considerations: (1) nonselective inhibition of the JAK/STAT path-<lb/>way increases the risk of secondary infection such as herpes zoster <lb/>virus reactivation given its general inhibitory effects on multiple <lb/>aspects of physiological actions, including the innate immune <lb/>system. 327,328 In addition, considering the general immunosup-<lb/>pressive nature, some researchers are concerned that continuous <lb/></body>

			<body>treatment with JAKinibs for autoimmune diseases may increase <lb/>the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections or contribute to poor outcomes <lb/>in COVID-19. Hence, several retrospective clinical trials have been <lb/>conducted to address these concerns; 329-334 (2) critical COVID-19 <lb/>is commonly accompanied by coagulopathy and thrombosis, and <lb/>the Food and Drug Administration has warned that administration <lb/>of some JAKinibs has increased the risk of thrombosis. 335 Thus, <lb/>developing JAKinibs with better specificity could be a future <lb/>direction of research aimed to prevent/reduce CS and improve the <lb/>survival of COVID-19 patients. <lb/>Blockade of NF-ÎºB signaling <lb/>The overwhelming expression of multiple pro-inflammatory <lb/>proteins in COVID-CS has indicated the central roles of pro-<lb/>inflammatory signaling pathways, and in particular, the NF-ÎºB <lb/>pathway. Immunomodulation of NF-ÎºB activation has been <lb/>proven effective in SARS-CoV-infected cells or mice. 146 Thus, <lb/>recent reviews have proposed that the NF-ÎºB pathway represents <lb/>a potential therapeutic target for critical COVID-19 illness. 336-338 <lb/>An in vitro study showed that phillyrin (KD-1), a well-studied <lb/>anti-inflammatory and antioxidative agent, significantly reduced <lb/>the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and expression of pro-inflammatory <lb/>factors in Huh-7 cells via inhibition of the NF-ÎºB signaling <lb/>pathway. 339 Another study showed that a novel pyrazole <lb/>derivative remarkably reduced the expression of IL-6, TNFÎ±, and <lb/>IL-1Î² in LPS-stimulated RAW267.4 cells by inhibiting NF-ÎºB <lb/>signaling pathway activation. 340 It has been suggested that <lb/>blocking phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-ÎºB kinase subunit <lb/>beta, a primary downstream protein of NF-ÎºB signaling, with <lb/>pharmacological inhibitors may be an effective approach for <lb/>COVID-CS treatment. 339 Moreover, Liu Shen capsules, a traditional <lb/>Chinese medicine, were also reported to exert anti-viral and anti-<lb/>inflammatory effects in SARS-CoV-2-infected Huh-7 and Vero E6 <lb/>cells, respectively, by suppressing the NF-ÎºB signaling cascade. 341 <lb/>The effect of several anti-inflammatory or anti-viral drugs on <lb/>COVID-19 such as dexamethasone, 342 hydroxychloroquine, 343 <lb/>macrolide antibiotics, 344,345 and N-acetylcysteine 346,347 are also <lb/>related to NF-ÎºB cascade inhibition. <lb/>Despite the existence of various nonselective agents for NF-ÎºB <lb/>inhibition, developing selective NF-ÎºB inhibitors and a series of <lb/>clinical trials are urgently required to further validate the clinical <lb/>benefits. <lb/>Blockade of NLRP3 signaling <lb/>Several studies have shown that NLRP3 inflammasome is a <lb/>potential therapeutic target for COVID-CS. 164,348,349 <lb/>NLRP3 signaling inhibition may be a potential mechanism of <lb/>action for several anti-inflammatory drugs effective in COVID-19, <lb/>such as colchicine. Studies have shown that colchicine can <lb/>nonselectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammation by inhibiting the activa-<lb/>tion of P2X7 receptor or the interaction between NLRP3 protein and <lb/>ASC. 350,351 In addition, chloroquine 352 and curcumin 353 are also <lb/>capable of inhibiting NLRP3 signaling. Several investigational agents <lb/>capable of inhibiting NLRP3 activation, such as tranilast, 354 <lb/>dapansutrile (OLT1177, selective inhibitor), 354 and thiazolo-alkenyl <lb/>sulfonylurea derivative 7, 355 are also being considered for COVID-CS <lb/>treatment as reviewed by Freeman and Swartz. 164 In addition, some <lb/>nonselective or selective agents against NLRP3 inflammasome <lb/>including melatonin (NCT04409522), OLT1177 (NCT04540120), aÃ§ai <lb/>palm berry extract (Euterpe oleracea) (NCT04404218), and ZYIL1 <lb/>(selective inhibitor) (NCT04731324) are under investigation. <lb/>INTERVENTIONS TARGETING MULTIPLE CYTOKINES AND <lb/>PATHWAYS <lb/>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy <lb/>IVIg is a natural immunoglobulin pool with a highly diverse <lb/>antibody network and is administered to superimpose over a <lb/>patient&apos;s imbalanced repertoire caused by infections. 356 It has <lb/>been known for a while that a broad range of natural anti-cytokine <lb/>autoantibodies such as those against IL-1, IL-6, and IFN-Î³ can be <lb/>detected in the IVIg of healthy individuals. 357-360 Although how <lb/>the autoantibodies are induced is still poorly understood, it has <lb/>been demonstrated that many of the anti-cytokine autoantibodies <lb/>are neutralizing antibodies and may be responsible for the anti-<lb/>inflammatory effect of IVIg in inflammatory and autoimmune <lb/>disorders. <lb/>The potential efficacy of IVIg therapy was reported in SARS <lb/>and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. 361,362 In a randomized, <lb/>controlled trial including 84 COVID-19 patients, IVIg treatment <lb/>did not demonstrate any therapeutic benefits in severe cases; <lb/>however, a significant positive relationship between the number <lb/>of days from admission to IVIg treatment and the length of <lb/>hospitalization was observed, 363 which indicated the potential <lb/>clinical benefit of IVIg administration during the early stage of <lb/>COVID-19. In contrast, Suzuki et al. 364 reported the potential <lb/>efficacy of IVIg administration along with mechanical ventilation, <lb/>methylprednisolone, favipiravir, ivermectin, and tocilizumab <lb/>therapy in the late phase in an elderly patient with severe <lb/>COVID-19. <lb/>In general, these studies were inconsistent with respect to the <lb/>timing of IVIg administration, i.e., early phase vs. late phase; <lb/>therefore, a larger number of clinical trials are warranted. <lb/>Corticosteroid treatment <lb/>Corticosteroids are one of the most commonly used anti-<lb/>inflammatory drugs in the treatment of many inflammatory <lb/>disorders. They exert immunoregulatory effects by inhibiting the <lb/>expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of <lb/>various immune cells. At the beginning of 2020, corticosteroid <lb/>treatment in COVID-19 was either contraindicated or not recom-<lb/>mended, 365 because of the statement that no clinical data indicated <lb/>a benefit from corticosteroid treatment. Moreover, it even increased <lb/>the mortality and secondary infection rates in SARS-CoV and MERS-<lb/>CoV. 366 In March 2020, the RECOVERY trials, one of the largest <lb/>randomized, controlled trials for COVID-19 treatments including <lb/>~15% of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the UK, were launched. <lb/>The dexamethasone arm enrolled 2104 patients receiving a low-to-<lb/>moderate dexamethasone dose of 6 mg per day for 10 days and the <lb/>control arm comprised 4321 patients receiving standard care. <lb/>Compared to the control group, dexamethasone treatment reduced <lb/>the 28-day mortality by one-third in mechanically ventilated patients <lb/>and by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen only, but not in patients <lb/>with no need for ventilated support. 367 Therefore, the UK govern-<lb/>ment (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-coronaviru <lb/>s-treatment-approved-for-nhs-use-by-government/) and the National <lb/>Institutes of Health in the United States (https://www.covid19treat <lb/>mentguidelines.nih.gov/dexamethasone/) have authorized the stan-<lb/>dard use of dexamethasone in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who <lb/>require oxygen. In addition, a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials <lb/>showed that corticosteroid treatment was associated with a lower <lb/>28-day all-cause mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. 225 <lb/>Collectively, the clinical benefit of glucocorticoids in COVID-19 <lb/>treatment is based on the selection of the correct dose, correct <lb/>patient, and appropriate timing. Several studies have shown the <lb/>temporal dynamics of viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2. 368-370 After <lb/>the replicative peaks, immunopathological factors may play a <lb/>dominant role in the illness, while active viral replication may play <lb/>a secondary one. Therefore, the viral load may serve as an <lb/>indicator to determine the precise time of glucocorticoid <lb/>treatment. Moreover, in contrast to other agents, dexamethasone <lb/>is readily available worldwide at a low cost, which is beneficial in <lb/>developing countries with limited access to health care. However, <lb/>although corticosteroid improves clinical syndromes in critically ill <lb/>COVID-19 patients, its impact on CS is still unclear and requires <lb/>further investigation. <lb/></body>

			<body>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment <lb/>Previous studies have reported the therapeutic effects of several <lb/>TCMs such as Lizhong Decoction, 371 Liujunzi Decoction, 372 and <lb/>Huanglian Jiedu Decoction 373 on inflammatory diseases. Recently, <lb/>TCM treatment has also been shown effective for COVID-19 and <lb/>contributed substantially to control the pandemic in China. For <lb/>example, a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial by Nanshan <lb/>Zhong&apos; research team showed that Lianhuaqingwen capsule, a <lb/>repurposed Chinese herb, can ameliorate clinical symptoms and <lb/>shorten the recovery time in COVID-19 patients with no serious <lb/>adverse effects. 374 <lb/>Several TCMs may play an immunosuppressive role to treat CS via <lb/>multiple cytokines or pathways related to the CS. Yang et al. 375 <lb/>showed that Qingfei Paidu Decoction, one of the most well-known <lb/>anti-COVID-19 formulae, can defend against COVID-19 by regulating <lb/>multiple CS-related signaling pathways such as the NF-ÎºB and MAPK <lb/>pathways and cytokines such as TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-8. In addition, <lb/>Dai et al. 376 conducted a large-scale transcriptional study to evaluate <lb/>the effects of 578 herbs and all 338 reported anti-COVID-19 TCM <lb/>formulae on CS-related signaling, by combining high-throughput <lb/>sequencing-based screening assay with bioinformatics and <lb/>computer-aided drug design. The results showed that some herbs <lb/>might inhibit the IL-6 pathway, some, the TNF-Î± pathway, and some <lb/>drugs such as Guizhi and Qingfei Paidu Decoction may inhibit both <lb/>pathways. Together, these studies provide scientific evidence for the <lb/>administration of TCMs in COVID-CS. <lb/>Blockade of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) <lb/>It is challenging to block individual cytokines to achieve the desired <lb/>clinical benefit given the complicated crosstalk of cytokine signaling <lb/>during CS. 377 Thus, developing anti-inflammatory strategies with a <lb/>wide-spectrum inhibitory effect is urgently required. <lb/>CDK7 can regulate cell cycle and gene transcription. 378 Previous <lb/>studies have shown that blockade of CDK7 manipulated <lb/>inflammation resolution by remodeling antitumor immunity 378 <lb/>and regulating cytokine secretion. 379 A recent study by Wei <lb/>et al. 380 showed that small-molecule inhibitor, THZ1, mediated the <lb/>blockade of CDK7 and thus mitigated hyperinflammatory states <lb/>and CRS caused by CAR T cell therapy. Mechanistically, when CDK7 <lb/>is blocked by THZ1, various pro-inflammatory genes, especially <lb/>STAT1 and IL1 that are regulated by CDK7/RNA Pol II super-<lb/>enhancers, are preferentially suppressed at the transcriptional <lb/>level. This indicates that blockade of CDK7 may be a promising <lb/>strategy to treat CRS. Considering similar cytokine profiles <lb/>between COVID-CS and CRS, we can hypothesize that the strategy <lb/>may also work in COVID-CS. <lb/>CONCLUSIONS <lb/>Clinical and basic research studies have identified and character-<lb/>ized COVID-CS, which has greatly enhanced our understanding of <lb/>CS and related immunopathology in COVID-19. A full scenario of <lb/>COVID-CS is now emerging, and it appears to be much larger in <lb/>scale and contains more cytokines than the CS recognized in other <lb/>conditions, and is therefore also more damaging. Although it is <lb/>still unclear how the virus turns the protective cytokine profile into <lb/>an inflammatory CS, the cytokines appear to be produced <lb/>predominantly by innate cells because the lymphopenia was <lb/>frequently reported in this condition. While the causative efficacy <lb/>of individual cytokines on the development of certain immuno-<lb/>pathogenic parameters in this condition is yet to be fully <lb/>understood; it is obvious that COVID-CS as a whole is closely <lb/>associated with the major pathogenic changes of COVID-19. To <lb/>treat COVID-CS, several biologic interventions specifically target-<lb/>ing inflammatory cytokines or related signaling pathways have <lb/>been clinically evaluated with promising results and many others <lb/>are in the pipeline. <lb/>In principle, the treatment strategy should be to control <lb/>ongoing inflammatory cytokine production or activity and resume <lb/>the host&apos;s homeostasis. However, we still lack safe and effective <lb/>drugs to control the CS, and clinically, the treatment of CS has <lb/>been proved difficult for several reasons: (1) many medical doctors <lb/>are not aware of the condition and hence, clinical diagnosis and <lb/>treatment guidelines are currently lacking; (2) it is a pharmaceu-<lb/>tical challenge to simultaneously target multiple cytokines. It is <lb/>therefore important to identify and target the key cytokines <lb/>upstream and the cytokine induction network, or directly target <lb/>the predominant cytokine-producing cells such as monocytes and <lb/>macrophages. Alternatively, learning from the host immunoregu-<lb/>latory system and identifying more effective and safer anti-<lb/>inflammatory factor/cytokines with a wide-spectrum inhibitory <lb/>effect may provide a better option for therapeutic intervention; IL-<lb/>37 has been suggested for this purpose; 381-384 (3) it is difficult to <lb/>balance CS and protective immunity in infectious diseases, as the <lb/>appropriate level of inflammatory cytokines is protective against <lb/>infections and inappropriately targeting inflammatory cytokines <lb/>may lead to acquired immunodeficiency and subsequent infec-<lb/>tions; (4) differences among individuals with respect to age, <lb/>immune status, and other comorbidities may result in virtual <lb/>differences in the component and scale of the CS and treatment. <lb/>Therefore, precise treatment is required. Of note, ideally targeting <lb/>predominant cytokines or molecular pathways in a particular CS <lb/>condition should be conducted first and in a timely manner. <lb/>COVID-19 has taught us a critical lesson regarding how to deal <lb/>with natural pathogenic enemies. Knowledge and treatment <lb/>options developed from COVID-CS will be invaluable, not just for <lb/>this disease but also for other CS conditions. <lb/></body>

In this study, we focused on plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), <lb/>and chemically synthesized novel plumbagins conjugated with C2:0 to C22:6 fatty acids (5-O-acyl plumbagins). These <lb/>chemically modified plumbagins enhanced mammalian pol inhibition and their cytotoxic activity. Plumbagin conjugated <lb/>with chains consisting of more than C18-unsaturated fatty acids strongly inhibited the activities of calf pol a and human pol <lb/>c. Plumbagin conjugated with oleic acid (C18:1-acyl plumbagin) showed the strongest suppression of human colon <lb/>carcinoma (HCT116) cell proliferation among the ten synthesized 5-O-acyl plumbagins. The inhibitory activity on pol a, a <lb/>DNA replicative pol, by these compounds showed high correlation with their cancer cell proliferation suppressive activity. <lb/>C18:1-Acyl plumbagin selectively inhibited the activities of mammalian pol species, but did not influence the activities of <lb/>other pols and DNA metabolic enzymes tested. This compound inhibited the proliferation of various human cancer cell <lb/>lines, and was the cytotoxic inhibitor showing strongest inhibition towards HT-29 colon cancer cells (LD 50 = 2.9 mM) among <lb/>the nine cell lines tested. In an in vivo anti-tumor assay conducted on nude mice bearing solid tumors of HT-29 cells, C18:1-<lb/>acyl plumbagin was shown to be a promising tumor suppressor. These data indicate that novel 5-O-acyl plumbagins act as <lb/>anti-cancer agents based on mammalian DNA replicative pol a inhibition. Moreover, the results suggest that acylation of <lb/>plumbagin is an effective chemical modification to improve the anti-cancer activity of vitamin K 3 derivatives, such as <lb/>plumbagin. <lb/>Citation: Kawamura M, Kuriyama I, Maruo S, Kuramochi K, Tsubaki K, et al.

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Cancer is a major global public health problem. Epidemiolog-<lb/>ical and animal studies have indicated that chemopreventive <lb/>natural products are associated with a reduced risk of cancer <lb/>development [1,2]. Furthermore, selective inhibitors of DNA <lb/>polymerases (pols) are considered potentially useful anti-cancer, <lb/>anti-viral, anti-parasitic, and anti-pregnancy agents because some <lb/>are known to suppress human cancer and normal cell prolifera-<lb/>tion, and are cytotoxic [3,4]. <lb/>Pol (DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, E.C. 2.7.7.7) catalyzes <lb/>deoxyribonucleotide addition to the 39-hydroxyl terminus of <lb/>primed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules [5]. The human <lb/>genome encodes at least 15 DNA pols, which function in cellular <lb/>DNA synthesis [6,7]. Eukaryotic cells contain three replicative pols <lb/>(a, d, and e), one mitochondrial pol (c), and at least 11 non-<lb/>replicative pols [b, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, terminal deoxynucleotidyl <lb/>transferase (TdT), and REV1] [8,9]. Pols have a highly conserved <lb/>structure, with their overall catalytic subunits showing little <lb/>variation among species; conserved enzyme structures are usually <lb/>preserved over time as they perform important cellular functions <lb/>that confer evolutionary advantages. Based on sequence homol-<lb/>ogy, eukaryotic pols can be divided into four main families, termed <lb/>A, B, X, and Y [8]. Family A includes mitochondrial pol c as well <lb/>as pols h and n; family B includes the three replicative pols a, d, <lb/>and e and also pol f; family X comprises pols b, l, and m as well as <lb/>TdT; and family Y includes pols g, i, and k in addition to REV1 <lb/>[9]. We have studied selective inhibitors of each pol derived from <lb/>natural products including food materials and nutrients for more <lb/>than 18 years [10,11]. We have found that vitamin K 3 , but not K 1 <lb/>or K 2 , is a potent inhibitor of human pol c [12,13]. <lb/>Vitamin K 3 (menadione, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, 3 of <lb/>Fig. 1) is a fat-soluble compound that contains quinone as its <lb/>principal chemical feature. Quinones are a class of organic <lb/>compounds that are derived from aromatic compounds via the <lb/>exchange of an even number of -CH = groups for -C( = O)-<lb/></body>

			<body>groups and any necessary rearrangement of double bonds, <lb/>resulting in a fully conjugated cyclic dione structure. The <lb/>toxicological properties of quinones, which act as alkylating <lb/>agents, have also been examined. For example, quinones are <lb/>known to interact with flavoproteins to generate reactive oxygen <lb/>species (ROS) that can induce biological injury [14-17]. In this <lb/>study, we focused on 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone <lb/>(plumbagin, 1 of Fig. 1), which has the common naphthoquinone <lb/>skeleton and a hydroxyl group and a methyl group at the C-5 and <lb/>C-2 positions, respectively. Plumbagin (1) is found in the plants of <lb/>the Plumbaginaceae, Droseraceae, Ancestrocladaceae, and Dion-<lb/>cophyllaceae families. The chief source of plumbagin (1) is the root <lb/>of Plumbago zeylanica L. (also known as &apos;&apos;Chitrak&apos;&apos;). Plumbagin (1) <lb/>has been shown to exert anti-carcinogenic, anti-atherosclerotic, <lb/>and anti-microbial effects [18-21]. The root of P. zeylanica L. has <lb/>been used in Indian medicine for approximately 2,750 years and <lb/>its components possess anti-atherogenic, cardiotonic, hepatopro-<lb/>tective, and neuroprotective properties [19]. Plumbagin (1) has <lb/>potent anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities in various types of <lb/>human cancers, and its mechanism of cytotoxicity is by inhibition <lb/>of a PI-5 kinase for ROS generation [22]. <lb/>We previously found that a vitamin K 3 (3) derivative, juglone (5-<lb/>hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 4 of Fig. 1), conjugated with fatty <lb/>acids such as 5-O-acyl juglones (5a-j of Fig. 1) were stronger pol <lb/>inhibitors than juglone alone (4) [23], therefore, ten 5-O-acylated <lb/>derivatives of plumbagin (2a-j of Fig. 1) were chemically <lb/>synthesized from plumbagin (1) and fatty acids to compare with <lb/>5-O-acyl juglones (5a-j). In this study, we first investigated the <lb/>stability of 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2) and 5-O-acyl juglones (5). We <lb/>also assayed the inhibitory effects of ten 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2a-<lb/>j) on mammalian pol activity, cytotoxicity in human cancer cell <lb/>lines and in vivo anti-tumor activity compared with plumbagin (1) <lb/>and 5-O-acyl juglones (5). The relationship between the pol <lb/>inhibitory and anti-tumor effects of vitamin K 3 -based acylated <lb/>derivatives is discussed. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Materials <lb/>A chemically synthesized DNA template, poly(dA), was <lb/>purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. and a customized oligo(dT) 18 <lb/>DNA primer was produced by Sigma-Aldrich Japan K.K. <lb/>(Hokkaido, Japan). Radioactive nucleotide [ 3 H]-labeled 29-deox-<lb/>ythymidine-59-triphosphate (dTTP; 43 Ci/mmol) was obtained <lb/>from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA, USA). All other <lb/>reagents were of analytical grade from Nacalai Tesque Inc. <lb/>(Kyoto, Japan). <lb/>Enzymes <lb/>Pol a was purified from calf thymus by immunoaffinity column <lb/>chromatography as described by Tamai et al. [24]. Recombinant <lb/>rat pol b was purified from Escherichia coli JMpb5 as described by <lb/>Date et al. [25]. The human pol c catalytic gene was cloned into <lb/>pFastBac. Histidine-tagged enzyme was expressed using the <lb/>BACTO-BAC HT Baculovirus Expression System according to <lb/>the manufacturer&apos;s instructions (Life Technologies, Frederick, <lb/>MD, USA) and purified using ProBound resin (Invitrogen Japan, <lb/>Tokyo Japan) [26]. Human pols d and e were purified by nuclear <lb/>fractionation of human peripheral blood cancer cells (Molt-4) <lb/>using the second subunit of pol d and e-conjugated affinity column <lb/>chromatography, respectively [27]. A truncated form of human <lb/>pol g (residues 1-511) tagged with His 6 at its C-terminal was <lb/>expressed in E. coli cells and purified as described by Kusumoto et <lb/>al. [28]. A recombinant mouse pol i tagged with His 6 at its C-<lb/>terminal was expressed and purified by Ni-NTA column <lb/>chromatography [29]. A truncated form of pol k (residues 1-<lb/>560) with 66 His-tags attached at the C-terminus was overex-<lb/>pressed in E. coli and purified as described by Ohashi et al. [30]. <lb/>Recombinant human His-pol l was overexpressed and purified <lb/>according to a method described by Shimazaki et al. [31]. <lb/>Recombinant human His-pol m was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 <lb/>and purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare Bio-<lb/>Science Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA) column chromatography <lb/>according to the method for pol l preparation by Shimazaki et al. <lb/>[31]. Pol a from a higher plant, cauliflower, was purified from the <lb/>inflorescence structure according to the methods outlined by <lb/>Sakaguchi et al. [32]. Recombinant rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. <lb/>Nipponbare) pol l tagged with His 6 at the C-terminus was <lb/>expressed in E. coli and purified as described by Uchiyama et al. <lb/>[33]. Calf TdT, Taq pol, T4 pol, T7 RNA polymerase, and T4 <lb/>polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Takara Bio Inc. <lb/>(Kyoto, Japan). The Klenow fragment of pol I from E. coli was <lb/>purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Freehold, NJ, <lb/>USA). Bovine pancreas deoxyribonuclease I was obtained from <lb/>Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA, USA). <lb/>Measurement of pol activity <lb/>The reaction mixtures for calf pol a, rat pol b, plant pol a, and <lb/>prokaryotic pols have been described previously [34,35]; those for <lb/>pol c as well as pols d and e were previously described by Umeda <lb/>et al. [26] and Ogawa et al. [36], respectively. Those for pols g, i, <lb/>and k were the same as for pol a, and those for pols l and m were <lb/>the same as for pol b. For the pol reactions, poly(dA)/oligo(dT) 18 <lb/>(A/T, 2/1) and dTTP were used as the DNA template-primer <lb/>substrate and nucleotide (dNTP; 29-deoxynucleoside-59-triphos-<lb/>phate) substrate, respectively. For the TdT reactions, oligo(dT) 18 <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>(39-OH) and dTTP were used as the DNA primer substrate and <lb/>nucleotide substrate, respectively. <lb/>The chemically synthesized 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2a-j) were <lb/>dissolved in distilled dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to various <lb/>concentrations and sonicated for 30 s. Subsequently, 4 mL aliquots <lb/>were mixed with 16 mL of each enzyme (0.05 units) in 50 mM <lb/>Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol <lb/>(by vol), and 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and held at <lb/>0uC for 10 min. These inhibitor-enzyme mixtures in 8 mL volumes <lb/>were next added to 16 mL of enzyme standard reaction mixture <lb/>and incubated at 37uC for 60 min, except for Taq pol, which was <lb/>incubated at 74uC for 60 min. Activity without inhibitor was <lb/>considered 100%, and the relative activity was determined for <lb/>each inhibitor concentration. One unit of pol activity was defined <lb/>as the amount of each enzyme that catalyzed the incorporation of <lb/>1 nmol dTTP into synthetic DNA template primers in 60 min, at <lb/>37uC, and under standard reaction conditions [34,35]. <lb/>Other enzyme assays <lb/>The activities of calf primase of pol a, T7 RNA polymerase, <lb/>mouse inosine-59-triphosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (type II), T4 <lb/>polynucleotide kinase, and bovine deoxyribonuclease I were <lb/>measured in standard assays according to the manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>specifications, as described by Tamiya-Koizumi et al. [37], <lb/>Nakayama and Saneyoshi [38], Mizushina et al. [39], Soltis et <lb/>al. [40], and Lu and Sakaguchi [41], respectively. <lb/>Thermal transition of DNA <lb/>Thermal transition profiles of dsDNA to single-stranded DNA <lb/>with or without test compound were obtained with a spectropho-<lb/>tometer (UV-2500; Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with <lb/>a thermoelectric cell holder according to previous methods [42]. <lb/>Calf thymus DNA (6 mg/mL) was dissolved in 0.1 M sodium <lb/>phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1% DMSO. The solution <lb/>temperature was equilibrated to 75uC for 10 min, and then <lb/>increased by 1uC at 2-min intervals for each measurement point. <lb/>Any change in the absorbance (260 nm) of the compound itself at <lb/>each temperature point was automatically subtracted from that of <lb/>DNA plus the compound in the spectrophotometer. <lb/>Cell culture and measurement of cancer cell viability <lb/>The following human cancer cell lines were obtained from the <lb/>American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA): lung <lb/>(A549), prostate (DU145 and PC3), colon (HCT116 and HT-29), <lb/>cervix (HeLa), hepatocellular liver (HepG2), breast (MCF-7), and <lb/>pancreatic cancer (PANC-1). These cells were cultured in RPMI <lb/>1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, <lb/>penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL), and <lb/>1.6 mg/mL NaHCO 3 at 37uC in a humid atmosphere of 5% <lb/>CO 2 /95% air. For the cell viability assay, cells were seeded at <lb/>1610 3 cells/well in a 96-well microplate with various concentra-<lb/>tions of the test compounds, and incubated for 48 h. MTT (3-(4,5-<lb/>dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) solution <lb/>was added to a final concentration 0.6 mg/mL in Milli-Q purified <lb/>water for 2 h [43], after which time the medium was discarded <lb/>and the cells lysed in DMSO. A 540 was then measured in a <lb/>microplate reader (Model 680, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, <lb/>CA, USA). <lb/>In vivo assessment of anti-tumor assay <lb/>Male BALB/c nu/nu mice at 5 week of age (18 g) were <lb/>purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). Mice receiving <lb/>standard laboratory chow and water ad libitum were acclimatized <lb/>for 1 week before inoculation with cancer cells. For in vivo <lb/>experiments, human colon HT-29 cells (1610 7 cells/mouse) were <lb/>subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Mice bearing solid tumors <lb/>that had grown to approximately 100 mm 3 in volume (tumor <lb/>volume = length6width6height) at 12 days after implantation <lb/>were used for the assessment of anti-tumor effects. They were <lb/>divided randomly into five groups (n = 6/group). One of the five <lb/>groups was a control group injected with 0.1 mL of phosphate <lb/>buffered saline (PBS) alone, and other groups were injected with <lb/>vitamin K 3 (3), juglone (4), C18:1-acyl juglone (5f), and C18:1-acyl <lb/>plumbagin (2f) dissolved in PBS at a dose of 5 mg/kg. The above <lb/>administrations all took place between days 12-39 subsequent to <lb/>implantation. All mice were injected subcutaneously 14 times at 1-<lb/>day intervals with the compound and PBS alone (control). Tumor <lb/>growth was measured at 1-day intervals for 40 days after <lb/>implantation. At the end of the in vivo anti-tumor assay, some <lb/>mice treated with the test compounds and PBS were indepen-<lb/>dently examined to observe major organs such as lung, heart, <lb/>spleen, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney, intestine, and brain. <lb/>This animal study was approved by the Institutional Animal <lb/>Care and Use Committee of Kobe Gakuin University, and was <lb/>performed according to the guidelines outlined in the Care and <lb/>Use of Laboratory Animals of Kobe Gakuin University. The <lb/>animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital before undergoing <lb/>cervical dislocation. The mice that had been bred in-house with <lb/>free access to food and water were used for all experiments. All of <lb/>the mice were maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle and <lb/>housed at a room temperature of 25uC. <lb/>Analytical instruments for synthetic 5-O-acyl plumbagins <lb/>(2a-j) <lb/>Melting points, determined on a Yanaco Micro Melting Point <lb/>apparatus, are uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorded on a <lb/>Bruker spectrometer (Avance 400). Chemical shifts are expressed <lb/>in d (ppm) relative to Me 4 Si or the residual solvent resonance, and <lb/>coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hz. The following <lb/>abbreviations are used for spin multiplicity: s = singlet, d = doublet, <lb/>t = triplet, q = quartet, quin = quintet, m = multiplet, br = broad. <lb/>Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded on a HORIBA FT-720, using <lb/>NaCl (neat) or KBr pellets (solid) and are reported in wavenum-<lb/>bers (cm 21 ). High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained <lb/>on a JEOL mass spectrometer (JMS-700 MStaion) using fast atom <lb/>bombardment (FAB), or a Fourier transformation-ion cyclotron <lb/>resonance-mass spectrometer, Bruker solariX (FT-ICR-MS) by <lb/>using electrospray ionization (ESI) and laser desorption ionization <lb/>(LDI) techniques. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) <lb/>was performed on Silica Gel 60 F 254 plates (Merck). Flash <lb/>chromatography was carried out on SiliaFlash F60 (Silicycle). <lb/>Synthesis and characterization of 5-O-acetoxy-2-methyl-<lb/>1,4-naphthoquinone (C2:0-Acyl plumbagin, 2a) <lb/>Acetic anhydride (0.5 mL) was added to a solution of plumbagin <lb/>(1) (107 mg, 0.57 mmol) in pyridine (1.0 mL), and the mixture was <lb/>stirred at room temperature for 4 h.

C18:1-<lb/>acyl plumbagin (2f) and C18:1-acyl juglone (5f) were treated with <lb/>Triton B (benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide) in 1,4-dioxane <lb/>and MeOH. As shown in Fig. 3, UV spectra of the mixture were <lb/>recorded at different reaction times. Almost no changes in UV <lb/>spectra of C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) were observed before and <lb/>after treatment of Triton B (Fig. 3A). UV spectra of the mixture of <lb/>C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) and Triton B rarely changed during the <lb/>reaction. In contrast, the changes in UV absorption of C18:1-acyl <lb/>juglone (5f) were clearly observed (Fig. 3B). UV absorption at <lb/>675 nm and 400 nm was observed soon after the addition of <lb/>Triton B. The absorption at 675 nm suggests the formation of an <lb/>extended aromatic compound by the reaction of C18:1-acyl <lb/>juglone with Triton B in 1,4-dioxane and MeOH. The absorption <lb/>at 675 nm became smaller during the reaction, suggesting that the <lb/>extended aromatic compound had decomposed. The absorption at <lb/>400 nm increased with reaction time. We observed weak and <lb/>broad absorption in the wavelength range 300-700 nm. These <lb/>results suggest that C18:1-acyl juglone (5f) readily decomposes <lb/>under basic conditions. <lb/>Effect of synthesized 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2a-j) on the <lb/>activities of mammalian pols <lb/>Initially, the inhibitory activity of each 5-O-acyl plumbagin (2a-<lb/>j) toward mammalian pols was investigated using calf pol a, and <lb/>human pols c, k, and l.

			<body>a set concentration (10 mM) of plumbagin (1) and the ten <lb/>chemically synthesized compounds showed that some 5-O-acyl <lb/>plumbagins were stronger inhibitors of these four mammalian pols <lb/>than plumbagin (1) (Fig. 4). The plumbagins conjugated with C18 <lb/>and longer chain unsaturated fatty acids (i.e., C18:1 to C22:6-acyl <lb/>plumbagins 2f-j) strongly inhibited the activities of pols a and c, <lb/>suggesting that the group of unsaturated longer acyl side chains <lb/>might be an important structural characteristic of 5-O-acyl <lb/>plumbagin for pol inhibition. C22:6-acyl plumbagin (2j) was the <lb/>strongest inhibitor of human pols k and l among the compounds <lb/>tested. In contrast, C2:0-acyl plumbagin (2a) hardly inhibited the <lb/>activities of human pols k and l, and C18:0-acyl plumbagin (2e) <lb/>did not inhibit pol a activity. When activated DNA (bovine <lb/>deoxyribonuclease I-treated DNA) was used as the DNA template-<lb/>primer substrate instead of synthesized DNA [poly(dA)/oli-<lb/>go(dT) 18 (A/T = 2/1)] and dNTP was used as the nucleotide <lb/>substrate instead of dTTP, the inhibitory effects of these <lb/>compounds did not differ (data not shown). <lb/>Effect of synthesized 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2a-j) on <lb/>cultured human cancer cells <lb/>Pols have emerged as important cellular targets for chemical <lb/>intervention in the development of anti-cancer agents [2]. <lb/>Therefore, the synthesized 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2a-j) could be <lb/>useful in chemotherapy. Hence, we investigated the cytotoxic <lb/>effect of these compounds against HCT116 human colon <lb/>carcinoma cells. As shown in Fig. 5, 100 mM plumbagin (1) <lb/>approximately 50% suppressed cell proliferation, but 10 mM of <lb/>this compound did not. Of the ten synthesized compounds, the <lb/>nine 5-O-acyl plumbagins except for C18:0-acyl plumbagin (2e) <lb/>were stronger cell proliferation inhibitors than plumbagin (1). <lb/>C18:1-Acyl plumbagin (2f) and C18:2-acyl plumbagin (2g) had <lb/>the first and second strongest proliferation inhibitory effect on <lb/>HCT116 cells among the compounds tested, and at 10 mM <lb/>compound these cells showed less than 40 and 60% of the cell <lb/>proliferation rate, respectively. <lb/>Relationship of mammalian pol inhibition and human <lb/>cancer cell proliferation suppression by 5-O-acyl <lb/>(2a-j) <lb/>The possible relationship between the observed inhibition of <lb/>four mammalian pol families and HCT116 human colon cancer <lb/>cell proliferation inhibitory activity was confirmed by comparing <lb/>the effects of plumbagin (1) and the ten synthesized 5-O-acyl <lb/>Figure 7.

			<body>respectively, were related to cytotoxicity, with a correlation <lb/>coefficient between these activities and cytotoxicity of ,0.25. <lb/>These results led to the speculation that the inhibition of the <lb/>activities of DNA replicative pols, such as pols a and c; in <lb/>particular, inhibition of both the A and B families of pols by <lb/>compounds 1 and 2a-j might cause the suppression of human <lb/>cancer cell proliferation. <lb/>In particular, C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) showed the strongest <lb/>inhibition of pol c of the ten synthesized 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2a-<lb/>j) tested. This compound also exhibited the strongest effects on <lb/>cancer cell proliferation suppression (Fig. 5). Therefore, C18:1-<lb/>acyl plumbagin (2f) was used in the latter part of this study. <lb/>Effects of C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) on the activities of <lb/>various pols and other DNA metabolic enzymes <lb/>As described briefly in the Introduction, we succeeded in <lb/>obtaining eleven mammalian pol species, including pols a, b, c, d, <lb/>e, g, i, k, l, and m, and TdT; however, pols f, h and n, and REV1 <lb/>were not yet available at the time of the study. Currently, <lb/>eukaryotes are thought to express at least 15 species of pols [6,7], <lb/>and we are still in an era when most pols are very difficult to obtain <lb/>in their purified form in a laboratory. Table 1 shows the inhibitory <lb/>effect (50% inhibitory concentration; IC 50 value) of C18:1-acyl <lb/>plumbagin (2f) against various pol species including the 11 <lb/>mammalian pols that could be obtained. This compound inhibited <lb/>the activity of all of the mammalian pols with IC 50 values of 4.5-<lb/>10.6 mM, and 50% inhibition of the A, B, X, and Y families of pols <lb/>was observed at doses of 4.5, 4.8-5.3, 9.2-10.6, and 7.6-8.2 mM, <lb/>respectively; therefore, the inhibitory effect of this compound on <lb/>the A and B families of pols was 1.5-to 2-fold stronger than that on <lb/>the X and Y families of pols. Because the IC 50 values of <lb/>aphidicolin, a known eukaryotic DNA replicative pol a, d, and e <lb/>inhibitor, were 20, 13, and 16 mM, respectively [45], the pol <lb/>inhibitory activity of C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) was .2-fold more <lb/>potent than that of aphidicolin. <lb/>In contrast, C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) had no effect on plant <lb/>pols such as cauliflower pol a or rice pol l, or prokaryotic pols, <lb/>such as E. coli pol I, Taq pol, or T4 pol (Table 1). The three-<lb/>dimensional structures of eukaryotic pols are likely to differ greatly <lb/>from those of prokaryotic pols. This compound did not inhibit the <lb/>activity of other DNA metabolic enzymes, such as calf primase pol <lb/>a, 7 RNA polymerase, mouse IMP dehydrogenase (type II), T4 <lb/>polynucleotide kinase, or bovine deoxyribonuclease I. These <lb/>results suggest that 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2) may be selective <lb/>inhibitors of mammalian pols; in particular, plumbagin (1) <lb/>conjugated with unsaturated fatty acids, such as C18:1-acyl <lb/>plumbagin (2f), potently inhibited the activities of the A and B <lb/>families of pols. <lb/>Influence of C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) on the <lb/>hyperchromicity of dsDNA <lb/>Specific assays were performed to determine whether C18:1-<lb/>acyl plumbagin (2f)-induced inhibition resulted from the ability of <lb/>the compound to bind to DNA or the enzyme. The interaction of <lb/>C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) with dsDNA was investigated by <lb/>studying its thermal transition. For this, the melting temperature <lb/>(T m ) of dsDNA in the presence of an excess of C18:1-acyl <lb/>plumbagin (2f) (100 mM) was observed using a spectrophotometer <lb/>equipped with a thermoelectric cell holder. As shown in Fig. 7, a <lb/>thermal transition (i.e., T m ) from 75 to 90uC was not observed <lb/>within the concentration range used in the assay, whereas when a <lb/>typical intercalating compound, such as ethidium bromide (EtBr, <lb/>15 mM), was used as a positive control, an obvious thermal <lb/>transition was observed. <lb/>The question of whether the inhibitory effect of C18:1-acyl <lb/>plumbagin (2f) resulted from nonspecific adhesion to mammalian <lb/>pols or from its binding to these enzymes was investigated by <lb/>determining if an excessive amount of nucleic acid [poly(rC)] or <lb/>protein (BSA; bovine serum albumin) prevented the inhibitory <lb/>effect of C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f). Poly(rC) and BSA had little or <lb/>no influence on pol inhibition by C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) (data <lb/>not shown), suggesting that this compound selectively bound to the <lb/>pol molecule. These observations indicated that C18:1-acyl <lb/>plumbagin (2f) did not act as a DNA intercalating agent or as a <lb/>template-primer substrate. <lb/>Collectively, these results suggested that C18:1-acyl plumbagin <lb/>(2f) might be a potent and specific inhibitor of mammalian pols. <lb/>Subsequently, we investigated whether pol inhibition by C18:1-<lb/>acyl plumbagin (2f) resulted in reduced human cancer cell <lb/>proliferation. <lb/>Effect of C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) on cultured human <lb/>cancer cell lines <lb/>C18:1-Acyl plumbagin (2f) treatment for 48 h suppressed the <lb/>proliferation of various human cancer cells in a dose-dependent <lb/>manner. As shown in Table 2, C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) <lb/>prevented the proliferation of nine human cancer cell lines, such <lb/>as A549, DU145, HCT116, HeLa, HepG2, HT-29, MCF-7, <lb/>PANC-1, and PC3 cells, with LD 50 values of 2.9-21.0 mM. These <lb/>results suggested that this compound could have suppressive <lb/>activity against the different type of cancer cell lines. In particular, <lb/>this compound showed the strongest cell proliferation suppression <lb/>in the colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and HT-29, with LD 50 <lb/>values of 6.5 and 2.9 mM, respectively. These dose-response curves <lb/>by MTT detection were the same as that obtained by trypan blue <lb/>staining (data not shown), suggesting that C18:1-acyl plumbagin <lb/>(2f) might cause a direct toxic effect on the cells. Because these <lb/>LD 50 s were similar to the IC 50 s for pols (Table 1), this inhibition <lb/>must be mostly led by the function of pols, such as DNA replicative <lb/>pol a. C18:1-Acyl plumbagin (2f) more strongly suppressed the <lb/>proliferation of these human cancer cell lines than aphidicolin, <lb/>which is an inhibitor of eukaryotic DNA replicative pols (data not <lb/>shown). <lb/>Effect of C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) on in vivo anti-tumor <lb/>activity <lb/>Because the cell proliferation inhibitory effect of C18:1-acyl <lb/>plumbagin (2f) was the strongest on HT-29 cells among the nine <lb/>human cancer cell lines tested (Table 2), this cell line was used in <lb/>vivo anti-tumor assays. In this assay, we investigated whether <lb/>C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) was more stable and/or had stronger <lb/>bioactivity than C18:1-acyl juglone (5f) in vivo; thus, C18:1-acyl <lb/>plumbagin (2f) was compared with vitamin K 3 (3), juglone (4), and <lb/>C18:1-acyl juglone (5f). <lb/>HT-29 cells were subcutaneously injected into 40 nude mice. At <lb/>12 days after the implantation, these nude mice were sorted five <lb/>groups (one control group and four treatment groups) and each <lb/>mouse group contained 6 mice bearing solid tumor volume of 96-<lb/>102 mm 3 . The sorted nude mice were injected with each test <lb/>compound dissolved in PBS (5 mg/kg) at 1-day intervals until 40 <lb/>days. As shown in Fig. 8A, these compounds suppressed tumor <lb/>growth as compared with the control (PBS) group, and the <lb/>decreased rates of tumor volume at 40 days following injection <lb/>with vitamin K 3 (3), juglone (4), C18:1-acyl juglone (5f), and <lb/>C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) were 7.0, 9.2, 10.3, and 30.5%, <lb/></body>

			<body>respectively. C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) showed more than a 3-fold <lb/>stronger anti-tumor effect than the other compounds tested, <lb/>suggesting that C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) must be stable in vivo, <lb/>but C18:1-acyl juglone (5f) did not. A significant correlation was <lb/>found between 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2) and the inhibition of <lb/>mammalian pols, especially DNA replicative pol a (Fig. 6A). <lb/>C18:1-Acyl plumbagin (2f) may be able to penetrate cancer cells of <lb/>tumor in mouse and reach the nucleus, inhibiting the activities of <lb/>pols and then the inhibition of pol activity by this compound may <lb/>lead to cell proliferative suppression and prevent tumor growth. <lb/>None of the nude mice showed any significant loss of body <lb/>weight throughout the experimental period (Fig. 8B). It was also <lb/>noted that the main visceral organs, such as the liver, lung, kidney, <lb/>spleen, heart, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, pancreas, <lb/>and testis of all the groups showed no toxic or degenerative <lb/>histological appearance (data not shown); therefore, C18:1-acyl <lb/>plumbagin (2f) is of interest as a candidate material for anti-cancer <lb/>treatment. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>We previously found that vitamin K 3 (2-methyl-1,4-naphtho-<lb/>quinone), juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) conjugated <lb/>with fatty acids inhibited the activity of mammalian pols. In this <lb/>study, 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2), which are plumbagins (5-hydroxy-<lb/>2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) conjugated with fatty acid, were <lb/>produced to establish an efficient chemical synthesis method. In <lb/>the synthesized ten 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2a-j), 2c-j are novel <lb/>compounds. These synthesized compounds were stronger inhib-<lb/>itors of the mammalian pols a, c, k, and l representing the pol <lb/>families B, A, Y, and X, respectively, than plumbagin (1). Of the <lb/>synthesized compounds, C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) showed the <lb/>strongest suppression of human cancer cell proliferation. The <lb/>human cancer cytotoxicity of this compound was realized through <lb/>the inhibition of pols, which are essential for DNA replication as <lb/>well as cell division. Because C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) potently <lb/>inhibited the activities of replicative pols, such as pols a and c and <lb/>suppressed human cancer cell proliferation, they might show in vivo <lb/>anti-tumor activity without any side effects. The in vivo anti-tumor <lb/>effect of C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) was stronger than that of <lb/>C18:1-acyl juglone (5f), because C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f) is <lb/>more stable than C18:1-acyl juglone (5f) under basic conditions. <lb/>These results suggested that 5-O-acyl plumbagins (2), such as <lb/>C18:1-acyl plumbagin (2f), could be used as anti-cancer chemo-<lb/>therapy agents based on their mammalian pol inhibition. <lb/></body>

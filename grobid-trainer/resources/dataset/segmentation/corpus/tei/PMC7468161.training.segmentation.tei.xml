			<body>INTRODUCTION OF THE FGF/FGFR SIGNALING <lb/>Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are broad-spectrum mitogens and <lb/>regulate a wide range of cellular functions, including migration, <lb/>proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is well documented <lb/>that FGF signaling plays essential roles in development, metabo-<lb/>lism, and tissue homeostasis. The malfunction of FGF/FGF receptor <lb/>(FGFR) signaling axis is observed in a variety of human diseases, <lb/>such as congenital craniosynostosis and dwarfism syndromes, as <lb/>well as chronic kidney disease (CKD), obesity, insulin resistance, <lb/>and various tumors (Fig. 1). <lb/>FGF family is one of the most diverse growth factor groups in <lb/>vertebrates. In mice and humans, 22 FGF ligands have been <lb/>identified. Based on sequence homology and phylogeny, the 18 <lb/>canonical mammalian FGFs are divided into six subfamilies, including <lb/>five paracrine subfamilies and one endocrine subfamily. 1 Five <lb/>paracrine subfamilies contain the FGF1 subfamily (FGF1 and FGF2), <lb/>the FGF4 subfamily (FGF4, FGF5, and FGF6), the FGF7 subfamily <lb/>(FGF3, FGF7, FGF10, and FGF22), the FGF8 subfamily (FGF8, FGF17, <lb/>and FGF18), and the FGF9 subfamily (FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20). The <lb/>FGF19 subfamily (FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23) signals in an endocrine <lb/>manner. 1 <lb/>FGFs exert their pleiotropic effects by binding and activating <lb/>high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors that are coded by four <lb/>genes (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4) and FGFRL1, a truncated <lb/>FGFR without intracellular domain, 2 in mammals. FGFRs are single-<lb/>pass transmembrane proteins containing an extracellular domain, <lb/>a transmembrane domain (TMD), and an intracellular tyrosine <lb/>kinase domain. Among them, the extracellular domain is <lb/>composed of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (D1-D3), <lb/>an acidic region, a heparin-binding motif for FGFs, heparan <lb/>cofactors, and partner proteins. The TMD anchors the receptors in <lb/>cell membrane and facilitates its dimerization. In the cytosol, the <lb/>juxtamembrane region of FGFRs is involved in receptor dimeriza-<lb/>tion, while the split kinase domains are required for the <lb/>transmitting of FGF-related signaling. 3 <lb/>The binding of FGFs to the inactive monomeric FGFRs will <lb/>trigger the conformational changes of FGFRs, resulting in <lb/>dimerization and activation of the cytosolic tyrosine kinases by <lb/>phosphorylating the tyrosine residues within the cytosolic tail of <lb/>FGFRs. 4 Then, the phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as the <lb/>docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, such as FGFR <lb/>substrate 2α, which is localized on the plasma membrane. 5 FGFRs <lb/>also recruit and phosphorylate SH2 domain-containing substrate <lb/>phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) by formatting an allosteric 2:1 <lb/>FGFR-PLCγ complex, indicating that FGFR dimerization plays an <lb/>obligatory role in substrate phosphorylation. 6 Depending on the <lb/>cellular content in distinct cells and tissues, the classical FGF/FGFR <lb/>downstream signaling pathways include Ras/Raf-MEK-MAPKs <lb/>(mitogen-activated protein kinases), phosphatidylinositol-3 <lb/>kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), PLCγ, and signal transducer <lb/>and activator of transcription (STAT). 1,7 Additionally, several <lb/>proteins belonging to FGF synexpression group have been <lb/>identified, such as Sprouty (Spry), 8,9 XFLRT3, 10 SEF, 11,12 <lb/>MKP3, 13,14 and so forth. These proteins are themselves regulated <lb/>by FGF signaling and are tightly co-expressed with FGFs. Most of <lb/>them inhibit FGF/FGFR signaling by establishing negative feed-<lb/>back loops 15 (Fig. 2). <lb/>The diversified functions of FGF/FGFR signaling indicate the <lb/>complex regulation of the signaling cascades. FGF/FGFR signaling <lb/>can be modified at several levels, including ligand-receptor <lb/>binding specificity, 16 expressions 1 and alternative splicing, 17 and <lb/>the crosstalk between FGFs/FGFRs and other signaling cascades, 18 <lb/>such as BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) 19 and Wnt signal-<lb/>ings. 20,21 FGF/FGFR binding specificity/promiscuity combined with <lb/>ligand-dependent differences in receptor orientation is the main <lb/>mechanisms for the precise regulation of FGF-induced signaling. 16 <lb/>FGF/FGFR signaling is tightly regulated by the spatial and <lb/>temporal expressions of FGFs, FGFRs, and heparan sulfate <lb/>cofactors. 15,22 Diversified tissue distribution and different expres-<lb/>sion levels of signaling components, which influences the function <lb/></body>

			<body>of FGF/FGFR signaling, eventually affect the tissue development, <lb/>maintenance, and disease pathogenesis. 1 Alternative splicing and <lb/>translational initiation generate multiple isoforms of FGFs/FGFRs <lb/>and regulate their expression levels. 23 For example, the tissue-<lb/>specific alternative splicing in D3 of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 can <lb/>generate b and c isoforms, and thus determines the binding <lb/>specificity/promiscuity for individual FGFs at diverse cells and <lb/>tissues. 24 Furthermore, it is well documented that epigenetic <lb/>mechanisms, 25 the posttranslational modifications, such as <lb/>phosphorylation, 26 glycosylation, 27 ubiquitination, 28 and cellular <lb/>trafficking of FGFs/FGFRs 29,30 are also involved in the regulation of <lb/>the expressions of FGF/FGFR signaling components and the signal <lb/>specificity, intensity, and timing. <lb/>During the past decades, repaid progresses have been made <lb/>about the modulation of FGF/FGFR signaling cascades; these <lb/>studies not only deepen our understanding of the unique <lb/>properties of FGF/FGFR signaling, but also raise the opportunity <lb/>for developing new therapies targeting causative FGF/FGFR <lb/>signaling. <lb/>Coreceptors of FGFs/FGFRs <lb/>Usually, specific ligands require assembly of the ternary complexes <lb/>composed of ligand, receptor, and coreceptor at the cell surface to <lb/>initiate signal transduction. The coreceptors of FGF/FGFR cascade <lb/>include heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (for paracrine <lb/>FGFs) and Klotho (for endocrine FGFs). <lb/>HSPGs. HSPGs are glycoproteins, containing one or more <lb/>covalently attached heparan sulfate (HS) chains. According to their <lb/>location, the HSPGs are grouped into three groups: membrane <lb/>HSPGs, such as syndecans and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-<lb/>anchored proteoglycans (glypicans), the secreted extracellular <lb/>matrix HSPGs (agrin, perlecan, type XVIII collagen), and the <lb/>secretory vesicle proteoglycan, serglycin. 31 HSPGs is a mandatory <lb/>cofactor in paracrine FGF signaling. Paracrine FGFs have moderate <lb/>to high affinity for HSPGs, which shortens FGF diffusion distance <lb/>away from their secretion cells. The interaction also provides a <lb/>depot of regulatory factors that can be released by selective <lb/>degradation of the HS chains facilitating the formation of FGF <lb/>gradients essential for cell specification during development and <lb/>regeneration. 22 <lb/>Structural studies have revealed that the HSPG binding site of <lb/>FGFs contains the β1-β2 loop and the extended β10-β12 region, <lb/>and each FGF ligand has discrete affinity for HSPGs. 32 HSPG-<lb/>mediated FGF-specific morphogenetic gradients contribute to the <lb/>distinct function of FGFs. Importantly, endocrine FGFs such as <lb/>Fig. 1 Summary of the main roles of FGF/FGFR signaling in organ development, metabolism, and disease. FGF/FGFR signaling participates in <lb/>the development of almost all organ such as lung, heart, urinary system, brain, skeleton, muscle, and skin/appendage, as well as angiogenesis <lb/>and lymphangiogenesis. FGFs/FGFRs also have important effects on tissue repair, regeneration, and inflammation. Furthermore, endocrine <lb/>FGFs play critical roles in metabolism by regulating kidney, liver, brain, intestine, and adipose tissue. The malfunctions of FGF/FGFR signaling <lb/>lead to multiple kinds of diseases, such as genetic diseases, cancer, COPD, and CKD. The roles of FGF signaling in appendage development, <lb/>such as epidermis, hair, and glands, and so on, is not mentioned in this review.

			<body>FGF19 and FGF23 lack the paracrine-conserved glycine box and <lb/>the truncated β10-β12 region in the potential HS binding region, <lb/>reducing the binding affinity between HSPGs and the endocrine <lb/>FGFs (FGF19 subfamily), which allows these FGF ligands to <lb/>permeate through the HSPG-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) and <lb/>subsequently enter the blood circulation. 33 <lb/>Detailed crystal studies reveal that HSPGs promote the <lb/>formation of a 2:2:2 dimer between FGF, FGFR, and HSPGs. 34 By <lb/>engaging ligand and receptors in the dimer, HSPGs promote the <lb/>kinetics and thermodynamics of FGF-FGFR binding and dimeriza-<lb/>tion, which is required for the transmission of a sustained and <lb/>robust intracellular signals. 34 <lb/>Klotho. Klotho are coreceptors for endocrine FGF signaling. As <lb/>single-pass transmembrane proteins, Klotho consists of tandem KL <lb/>domains, and are homologous to β-glucosidases. Modeling <lb/>studies showed that the endocrine FGFs (FGF19, FGF21, and <lb/>FGF23) exhibit a negligible HSPGs binding affinity and poor <lb/>affinity for their cognate FGFRs, resulting in ineffective endocrine <lb/>FGF/FGFR binding and dimerization. 33 It is well established that α/ <lb/>β Klotho coreceptors are required for these ligands to initiate <lb/>respective signaling activity. 33 The Klotho coreceptors associate <lb/>constitutively with the c-splice isoforms of FGFR1-3 and FGFR4 to <lb/>promote their binding of FGFs and dimerization, reinforcing FGF/ <lb/>FGFR signaling specificity. For example, FGF23 can bind and <lb/>activate FGFR1c-α-Klotho, FGFR3c-α-Klotho, and FGFR4-α-Klotho. <lb/>A recent atomic structure study showed that α-Klotho simulta-<lb/>neously binds FGFR1c and FGF23, and dimerization of the <lb/>stabilized ternary complexes and receptor activation depend on <lb/>the binding of HS. 35 FGF19 activates FGFR1c-β-Klotho (KLB) and <lb/>FGFR4-KLB, whereas FGF21 mainly activates the FGFR1c-KLB <lb/>complex. 36 <lb/>Endocrine FGF/FGFR signaling rely on the interaction between <lb/>FGFRs and Klothos. Biochemical studies revealed that α-Klotho <lb/>combines with FGFR1c to create a de novo site for the FGF23 <lb/>carboxy tail, whereas KLB uses two distinct sites to independently <lb/>bind FGFR and the carboxy tail of FGF19 or FGF21. 37,38 The <lb/>proteolytically cleaved FGF23 carboxy tail can competitively <lb/>inhibit the binding of native FGF23 to the FGFR1c-α-Klotho <lb/>complex and thus downregulate FGF23 signaling. 39 In patients <lb/>with autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), the <lb/>mutations in the RXXR motif located in the carboxy tail abrogate <lb/>the proteolytic cleavage of FGF23 and thus elevate the serum <lb/>levels of full-length bioactive FGF23, which accelerates the <lb/>excretion of phosphate from the kidney. 40,41 Mutations in D3 <lb/>hydrophobic groove of FGFRc isoforms and FGFR4 residues <lb/>abolishes Klotho binding, indicating the overlapping between <lb/>FGFs and Klotho binding sites on FGFRs. 38 The association of <lb/>FGFRs with the Klotho coreceptor decreases the ability of these <lb/>receptors to respond to paracrine FGFs, such as FGF8, supporting <lb/>the notion that endocrine and paracrine FGF signaling affect each <lb/>other. 38 <lb/>Modulators of FGF/FGFR signaling <lb/>Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). CAMs are typically single-pass <lb/>transmembrane receptors and include four major groups: <lb/>cadherins, integrins, the Ig superfamily of CAMs (IgCAMs), and <lb/>the superfamily of C-type of lectin-like domains proteins. 42 A <lb/>growing body of data reveals that various CAMs can act as FGFR <lb/>binding partners, participating in the modulating of FGF/FGFR <lb/>signaling and are strongly implicated in cell fate determination of <lb/>different cell lineages. 43 <lb/>Cadherins play an essential role in the formation and adaptive <lb/>reinforcement of adherens junctions, and modulation of the <lb/>dynamics of actin cytoskeleton. 44 Different members of the <lb/>cadherin family are expressed in a cell type-specific manner, and <lb/>most of the cell types express multiple cadherins, including VE-, N-<lb/>, and T-cadherin. N-cadherin is associated with FGFRs through <lb/>their acidic box-mediated activation of FGFRs and their down-<lb/>stream signaling in numerous cells. 45 In breast cancer cells, <lb/>Fig. 2 The classical FGF/FGFR pathways.

			<body>formation of N-cadherin complexes with FGFR1 can decrease the <lb/>internalization and lysosomal degradation of FGFR1, and thus <lb/>sustain the receptor signaling via MAPKs, whereas silencing of N-<lb/>cadherin results in the accelerated FGFR1 degradation. Thus, N-<lb/>cadherin stabilizes FGFR1 and simultaneously enhances FGF2-<lb/>induced proliferation and differentiation of epiblast stem cells. 46 In <lb/>addition, cadherin-11-FGFR1 interaction occurs through their <lb/>extracellular domains. Cadherin-11 initiates intracellular signaling <lb/>pathways via FGFR1 and recruits FGFR1 into the cell-cell contact <lb/>area. The cadherin-11-induced FGFR1 signaling stimulates neurite <lb/>outgrowth. 47 <lb/>The FGFR/neural CAM (NCAM) complexes have been observed <lb/>in multiple cell types. 48 The FN3 domains of NCAMs mediate its <lb/>interaction with the Ig2-Ig3 region of FGFRs. 49 NCAMs bind to <lb/>FGFR1-FGFR3 to activate the receptor and initiation of signaling <lb/>cascades and inhibit FGFR K27-and K29-linked polyubiquitination <lb/>and lysosomal degradation. 50 Interestingly, NCAMs can affect the <lb/>cellular trafficking of FGFRs. 51 In contrast to FGF-induced <lb/>activation and lysosomal degradation of endocytic FGFR1, NCAM <lb/>can promote the stabilization of FGFR1, which is recycled from <lb/>endosomes to the cell surface through a Rab11 and Src-<lb/>dependent manner. 51 <lb/>Integrins act as the receptors for extracellular matrix molecules, <lb/>playing a key role in regulating intercellular contact and <lb/>intracellular signaling. Eighteen α-subunits and eight β-subunits <lb/>assemble into 24 functional integrins that vary in terms of ligand <lb/>specificity and cellular function. 52 Each α-β combination can bind <lb/>to unique matrix components. Increasing evidences showed that <lb/>integrins modify FGF/FGFR signaling. 53 For example, the <lb/>fibronectin-binding α5β1-integrin dimer upregulates FGF2 expres-<lb/>sion, while secreted FGF2 directly binds to αvβ3 integrin. 54,55 <lb/>FGF1, FGFR1 and integrin αvβ3 can be assembled into a ternary <lb/>complex, in which FGF1 acts as a bridging molecule, to maintain <lb/>sustained activation of FGFR1-dependent kinases ERK1/2. 56 <lb/>NCAM is a member of IgCAMs containing Ig-like and fibronectin <lb/>type III (FNIII) domains. NCAM plays a critical role in neurite <lb/>outgrowth as binding partners affecting the signaling process. A <lb/>peptide derived from the NCAM FNIII region binds to FGFR1 <lb/>directly to stimulate FGFR1 phosphorylation in primary rat <lb/>neurons. 51 In PC12 cells, NCAM requires FGFRs to promote neurite <lb/>growth. 57 Specifically, the NCAM-FGFR interaction activates PLCγ <lb/>and diacylglycerol lipase to generate arachidonic acid, elevating <lb/>intracellular calcium levels and activating Ca 2+ -dependent protein <lb/>kinase C (PKCs). 58 NCAM has been found to form a complex with <lb/>FGFR4. This complex can lead to β1-integrin-mediated cell-matrix <lb/>adhesion, and also decrease the mobility of pancreatic tumor cells <lb/>by stimulating FGFR4 kinase activity. 59 <lb/>G protein-coupled receptors. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) <lb/>constitute the largest groups of receptors that mainly transmit <lb/>various signals across cell membranes through binding and <lb/>activating heterotrimeric G proteins. Structurally, GPCRs are <lb/>composed of an N-terminal extracellular domain, seven-<lb/>transmembrane helices, and a C-terminal region. 60 A growing <lb/>number of studies have revealed that various members of GPCRs <lb/>and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) can form heterocomplexes <lb/>together and trigger different intracellular signaling and cellular <lb/>response. 61,62 The GPCRs can transactivate multiple RTKs, 63 <lb/>including epidermal growth factor receptor, 64 platelet-derived <lb/>growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), 65 and insulin-like growth factor <lb/>receptors, 66 and so on. <lb/>In the central nervous system, both GPCR and FGFR signaling are <lb/>involved in the control of proliferation, migration, survival, and <lb/>differentiation of neurons. More and more studies have showed <lb/>that GPCRs form heterocomplexes with FGFRs and regulate the cell <lb/>fate of neurons. 67 Multiple methods have confirmed the interaction <lb/>between FGFR1 and adenosine receptor A2AR. The function study <lb/>revealed that this interaction is required for the enhanced <lb/>activation of ERK1/2, which is important for the regulation of the <lb/>synaptic plasticity. 68 Another study showed that cannabinoid <lb/>receptor 1 (CB1R)-FGFR1 complexes occur in the lipid rafts of the <lb/>plasma membrane, leading to activation of ERK1/2, and play <lb/>important roles in neuronal differentiation. 69 CB1R activates Fyn <lb/>and Src via PKC signaling, inducing the transactivation of FGFR1 by <lb/>phosphorylating its kinase domain. 69 The interactions between <lb/>FGFR1 and muscarinic acetylocholine receptor (mAChR) subtype <lb/>M1R and 5-hydroxytriptamine receptor 1A (5-HT1A) have been <lb/>visualized. 70 Stimulation of hippocampal neurons with M1R agonist <lb/>oxotremorine-M activated FGFR1, and the crosstalk between <lb/>mAChR and FGFR1 enhanced the neurite growth. 71 Treatment of <lb/>FGF2 and 5-HT1A agonist 7-(dipropylamino)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-<lb/>naphthalen-1-ol (8-OH-DPAT) can increase the FGFR1-5-HT1A <lb/>complexes; activation of 5-HT1A by 8-OH-DPAT causes subsequent <lb/>FGFR1 phosphorylation mediated by Src. 70 Interestingly, the FGFR1-<lb/>5-HT1A heterocomplexes display anti-depressive effects and thus <lb/>may be the novel targets for the treatment of mood disorders. 72 <lb/>Other RTKs. FGF/FGFR signaling can also be modified by their <lb/>interplay with other members of RTK family. The crosstalk among <lb/>RTKs can occur at different levels, such as the ligand, receptor, and <lb/>downstream cascades. Among them, different RTKs can form <lb/>receptor heterocomplexes and subsequently cause tyrosine <lb/>phosphorylation of one receptor by tyrosine kinase of the other <lb/>one. Binding with other RTKs gives another way to modify FGF/ <lb/>FGFR activities more elegantly. <lb/>Eph receptors constitute the largest family of RTKs, including <lb/>EphA (EphA1-EphA10) and EphB (EphB1-EphB6) receptors, and are <lb/>activated by ephrin ligands. 73 The Eph receptors contain structural <lb/>features characteristic for RTKs. The Eph receptor-ephrin com-<lb/>plexes regulate cell adhesion, organization of cytoskeleton, <lb/>angiogenesis, neural development, and plasticity. 74 EphA4 recep-<lb/>tor interacts with FGFRs through the tyrosine kinase domain of <lb/>Eph4 and the JM domain of FGFR1-4. 75 More detailed analysis <lb/>revealed that phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues within JM <lb/>domain of Eph4 is required for the formation of EphA4-FGFR <lb/>complexes. Kinase domains of EphA4 and FGFRs can trans-<lb/>phosphorylate each other. 75 Importantly, the ternary complex, <lb/>involving FGFR1, EphA4, and FRS2α, was detected. FRS2α may act <lb/>as a tethering molecule that integrates signals from both <lb/>receptors and regulates the self-renewal, proliferation, and <lb/>differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells. 76 Studies also <lb/>showed that FGFR phosphorylate ephexin1, a targeting molecule <lb/>of EphA receptors. 77 Scaffolding protein Dlg-1, which directly <lb/>interacts with EphA receptors, can also modulate FGFR signaling. 78 <lb/>PDGFRα and PDGFRβ are activated by multiple PDGFs: PDGF-<lb/>AA, PDGF-BB, PDGF-AB, PDGF-CC, and PDGF-DD. 79 PDGFR-<lb/>mediated signaling can regulate cell motility, proliferation, <lb/>angiogenesis, and are involved in a range of diseases. 80 In vitro <lb/>and in vivo experiments revealed that both PDGFRα and PDGFRβ <lb/>interact with high affinity with FGFR1. 81 The formation of PDGFRα-<lb/>FGFR1 complexes is facilitated by the presence of ligands for both <lb/>receptors. In receptor heterocomplex, PDGFRβ can directly <lb/>phosphorylate FGFR1 on tyrosine residues. 81 Interestingly, FRS2α <lb/>functions as a bridging molecule between PDGFRβ and FGFR1, <lb/>further supporting the speculation that FRS2α may act as a <lb/>tethering molecule integrating signals from different RTKs. 81 <lb/>Nuclear FGFs and FGFRs <lb/>In addition to the FGF/FGFR complexes at plasma membrane, it <lb/>has been recognized that canonical FGF ligands and FGFRs can <lb/>enter the nucleus of multiple types of cells and tissues. 82 Nuclear <lb/>localization of FGFs/FGFRs lends an additional layer of regulatory <lb/>complexity. 83,84 Nuclear FGFs/FGFRs can exert their effects on <lb/>proliferation, lineage commitment, and gene expressions. Dysre-<lb/>gulation of nuclear FGFs/FGFRs has been found in congenital <lb/>skeletal disorders and neoplastic transformation. 85 <lb/></body>

			<body>Nuclear localization of FGFs and FGFRs has been demonstrated <lb/>in multiple tissues in different pathophysiological conditions. <lb/>During gonadal development, FGFR2 is firstly localized to the <lb/>plasma membrane of proliferating sertoli progenitor cells, but in <lb/>the early stage of specification and differentiation, FGFR2 is <lb/>colocalized with SRY and SOX9 in the nucleus of sertoli cell. 86 In <lb/>the development of salivary gland, nuclear FGFR2 is specifically <lb/>located in proliferating epithelial cells at the branch tips in <lb/>response to FGF10. 87 In human pancreatic cancer cells, FGFR1 and <lb/>FGF2 are localized to the nucleus where they promote prolifera-<lb/>tion and invasion. 88 In breast mucinous carcinoma, nuclear FGFR2 <lb/>is commonly found colocalized with STAT5 and Runx2. 89 The <lb/>nuclear FGFR3 levels in breast, bladder, and pancreatic cancer cells <lb/>are higher than those in corresponding non-tumor tissues. 90 <lb/>Several FGF ligands contain a nuclear localization signal to <lb/>facilitate their nuclear import, and different mechanisms are <lb/>involved in the receptor nuclear localization. 91,92 In some cases, <lb/>nuclear localization of full-length FGFRs occurs through a <lb/>ligand-dependent mechanism. For example, FGF2, FGF1, and <lb/>FGF10 localize to the nucleus with FGFR1. 93,94 Structurally, all <lb/>FGFRs contain a single-pass TMD, the major determinant of <lb/>intracellular localization. Mutations in the TMD in FGFR1 and <lb/>FGFR2 remarkably affect their subcellular distribution. FGFR2 <lb/>mutations (FGFR2 M391R and FGFR2 Y381D ) located in the TMD can <lb/>reduce plasma membrane levels of FGFR2, and amplify its <lb/>nuclear and nucleolar presence in growth plate chondrocytes <lb/>derived from patients with skeletal disorder bent bone dysplasia <lb/>syndrome (BBDS). 95,96 Interestingly, posttranslational modifica-<lb/>tions, such as glycosylation, also contribute to the nuclear <lb/>localization of FGFRs. In the skeletal disorder Crouzon syn-<lb/>drome, the FGFR2 mutation (FGFR2 C278F ) leads to incomplete <lb/>FGFR2 glycosylation, blocks its membrane localization, and <lb/>induces the perinuclear accumulation of receptor. 97 It was <lb/>found that FGFR1 and FGFR2 exert their nuclear import through <lb/>a β-importin-dependent active nuclear pore-mediated mechan-<lb/>isms, 93 and proteolytically cleaved FGFR1 and FGFR3 mediated <lb/>by granzyme B and γ-secretase localize in the nucleus of <lb/>invading cancer cells and multiple cell lines, 94 but the detailed <lb/>molecular events are still unclear. <lb/>Once in the nucleus, FGFs and FGFRs can promote gene <lb/>expressions through multiple approaches, such as epigenetic <lb/>mechanisms. In embryonic stem cells and neuronal cells, FGFR1 <lb/>binds the proximal promoters and activates the transcription of <lb/>pluripotency-related genes, Wnt/β-catenin signaling components, <lb/>and P53. 98 In preosteoblasts, FGFR2 and FGF2 localize to the <lb/>nucleolus to recruit histone remodeling factors, such as the CBP <lb/>homolog p300, to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and activate RNA <lb/>polymerase I-mediated transcription, increasing ribosome biogen-<lb/>esis and subsequently protein synthesis. 95,96 Nuclear FGF/FGFR-<lb/>mediated regulation of transcription suggests an alternative way <lb/>through which FGFs/FGFRs can directly induce specific and rapid <lb/>changes of gene expressions. In osteoprogenitor cells, nuclear <lb/>FGFR2-mediated regulation of rDNA transcription promotes self-<lb/>renewal over terminal osteoblast differentiation. 95,96 In invading <lb/>breast cancer cells, FGFR1 undergoes nuclear translocation and <lb/>activates the transcription of genes critical for cell migration. 94 The <lb/>activating mutant FGFR2 Y376C in endometrial cancer has increased <lb/>perinuclear localization and appears to be involved in disrupting cell <lb/>polarity in metastatic cells. 99 In pancreatic cancer, nuclear FGFR3 <lb/>correlates with metastatic disease and poor overall prognosis. 90 <lb/>Compared with the well-established mechanisms in transmem-<lb/>brane signaling, the mechanisms for FGF/FGFR cascades in the <lb/>nucleus are less studied. Nuclear localization of RTKs is not unique <lb/>to the FGFs/FGFRs. 100,101 It is very important to clarify the precise <lb/>mechanisms for nuclear FGFR translocation, activation of down-<lb/>stream pathways, and target genes, as well as its functions in <lb/>different pathophysiological conditions in the future study. <lb/>FGF SIGNALING IN SKELETON DEVELOPMENT AND REPAIR/ <lb/>REGENERATION <lb/>Expressions of FGFs and FGFRs during skeleton development <lb/>Both FGFs and FGFRs have characteristic spatiotemporal expression <lb/>patterns throughout all stages of skeletal development (Table 1). 102 <lb/>During limb bud development, the active epithelial-mesenchymal <lb/>interactions between ectoderm-expressed FGF (FGF8) and FGFR2b, <lb/>and the mesenchyme-expressed FGF (FGF10) and FGFR1c, are <lb/>indispensable for the outgrowth and patterning of limbs. 103 FGFs 4, 8, <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>9, and 17 are specifically expressed in the mouse apical ectodermal <lb/>ridge (AER), a major signaling center at the distal edge to ensure <lb/>proper development of limb buds. FGF9 is located in regions <lb/>corresponding to mesenchymal condensations in AER, 104 and is only <lb/>expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the cartilaginous <lb/>condensations at the later stage. FGF9 is then expressed in the <lb/>perichondrium/periosteum and primary spongiosa. 105 In rat, Lazarus <lb/>et al. 106 found that FGFs 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 18, 21, and 22 are expressed in <lb/>the perichondrium, while FGFs 2, 7, 18, and 22 are expressed in the <lb/>growth plate. FGFs 1, 2, 17, and 19 are the predominant FGF ligands <lb/>expressed in human fetal growth plate cartilage. 107 FGF18 is <lb/>expressed in the periosteum, the articular surface, synovial tissue, <lb/>and in cells within the perichondrial groove of Ranvier. 108 During <lb/>intramembranous bone formation, FGF8 is expressed in developing <lb/>calvarial osteoblasts, FGF9 is expressed in calvarial mesenchyme, and <lb/>FGF18 is expressed in mesenchymal cells and differentiating <lb/>osteoblasts, whereas FGF23 is mainly produced by differentiated <lb/>osteoblasts and osteocytes. 109 <lb/>FGFR1 and FGFR2 are existed in mesenchymal cells prior to <lb/>morphological indication of mesenchymal condensation. FGFR1 is <lb/>evenly expressed in limb bud mesenchyme, while the expression <lb/>of FGFR2 is increased in chondrogenic condensation area, as the <lb/>first marker of chondrogenic condensation. Both FGFR1 and FGFR2 <lb/>are expressed in the periphery of the condensation, where is the <lb/>location of the origin cells of perichondrium and periosteum. 109 In <lb/>the established growth plates, FGFR3 is expressed mainly in the <lb/>resting, proliferating, and prehypertrophic zone. 110-112 As chon-<lb/>drocytes begin to hypertrophy, FGFR3 expression is shut down, <lb/>while the expression of FGFR1 is elevated. It has also been found <lb/>that FGFR2 is expressed in the resting zone, while FGFR4 is <lb/>expressed in the resting and proliferative zones. 106 FGFR3 is <lb/>expressed more intensely in latent chondroprogenitor cells <lb/>located in the groove of Ranvier and ring of LaCroix. 113 The <lb/>expressions of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in osteoblasts have been well <lb/>characterized. 112 FGFR3 is also found expressed in osteo-<lb/>blasts. 114,115 In cranial sutures, FGFRs are expressed in a spatial-<lb/>dependent manner. FGFR2 is predominantly expressed in <lb/>osteoprogenitor cells, while FGFR1 is located in more differen-<lb/>tiated osteoblasts. 116 FGFR3 has lower expression in the perios-<lb/>teum and sutural osteogenic fronts at the late stage of suture <lb/>development. 117 <lb/>FGF/FGFR-related genetic diseases with abnormal skeleton <lb/>development in humans <lb/>The characteristic expression patterns of FGFs/FGFRs imply the <lb/>critical roles of FGFs/FGFRs in skeletal development, and both <lb/>gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in <lb/>individual FGFRs or FGFs have been found to cause a variety of <lb/>genetic skeletal diseases in humans. <lb/>Mutations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FGFs <lb/>have been linked to multiple skeletal disorders. Constitutionally <lb/>increased dosage of FGF3 and FGF4 genes is a risk factor of <lb/>craniosynostosis. 118 Heterozygous mutation in FGF3 gene causes <lb/>deafness, congenital inner ear agenesis, microtia, and microdon-<lb/>tia. 119 Heterozygous mutation of FGF8 can lead to autosomal-<lb/>dominant hypogonadotropic hypogonadism-6 with or without <lb/>anosmia characterized by short stature, hyperlaxity of the digits, <lb/>camptodactyly, and mild scoliosis. 120 FGF8 mutation also <lb/>accounts for a small percentage of Kallmann syndrome (KS). 121 <lb/>FGF9 heterozygous missense mutations S99N and R62G have <lb/>been identified to be responsible for multiple synostoses <lb/>syndrome 3, and some individuals showed sagittal suture <lb/>synostosis and humeroradial synostoses in humans. 122,123 LOF <lb/>mutations in FGF10 cause an autosomal-dominant multiple <lb/>congenital disorder characterized by lacrimal duct aplasia, <lb/>malformed ears and deafness, and disturbed distal limb <lb/>segments, named lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome. 124 <lb/>FGF10 is identified as a genetic risk factor for nonsyndromic <lb/>cleft lip with or without cleft palate. 125 Truncated mutations of <lb/>FGF16 are associated with X-linked recessive hand malformations <lb/>with metacarpal 4/5 fusion. 126 Congenital hypogonadotropic <lb/>hypogonadism individuals caused by missense mutations of <lb/>FGF17 displayed low bone mass. 127 Missense mutations such as <lb/>R176Q, R179W, and R179Q in FGF23 cause ADHR, frequently <lb/>present with rickets, bone pain, and tooth abscesses. 128 LOF <lb/>mutations in FGF23 cause a rare autosomal recessive metabolic <lb/>disorder, hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis, char-<lb/>acterized by the progressive ectopic calcifications and elevated <lb/>serum phosphate levels. 129 <lb/>A GOF missense mutation in FGFR1 (P252A) leads to Pfeiffer <lb/>syndrome (PS), a craniosynostosis syndrome with characteristic <lb/>abnormalities, including broad thumbs and toes, brachydactyly or <lb/>variable syndactyly, and elbow ankylosis. 130,131 Several FGFR1 <lb/>mutations, such as N330I and C379R, result in osteoglophonic <lb/>dysplasia (OGD), characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, <lb/>including craniosynostosis and depressed nasal bridge, rhizomelic <lb/>dwarfism, and non-ossifying bone lesions. 132 LOF mutations such <lb/>as C277Y, R622X, and A167S in FGFR1 are responsible for <lb/>autosomal-dominant KS, characterized by hypogonadotropic <lb/>hypogonadism and anosmia. Some KS cases present skeletal <lb/>abnormalities, such as scoliosis, limb anomalies, and loss of nasal <lb/>cartilage. 133 GOF mutations of FGFR2, mainly in the third Ig-like <lb/>domain and adjacent linker regions (exons IIIa and IIIc), lead to <lb/>multiple types of autosomal-dominant craniosynostoses, such as <lb/>Apert syndrome (AS), Crouzon syndrome, and PS, as well as Beare-<lb/>Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome. 134-138 Several de novo missense <lb/>mutations of FGFR2 have been identified responsible for a <lb/>perinatal lethal skeletal dysplasia entitled as BBDS-FGFR2 type <lb/>characterized by deformities in multiple bone, including miner-<lb/>alization disorder of the calvarium, craniosynostosis, and dys-<lb/>morphic facial features, as well as bent long bones and <lb/>osteopenia. 139 GOF mutations in FGFR3 affect predominantly <lb/>bones developed through endochondral ossification causing <lb/>hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia (ACH), and thanatophoric <lb/>dysplasia (TD, type I/II). 140,141 GOF mutations in FGFR3 have also <lb/>been found to cause craniosynostoses. The A334T mutation of <lb/>FGFR3 cuases mild craniosynostosis, 142 while A391E mutation in <lb/>FGFR3 TMD is responsible for Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis <lb/>nigricans. 143 FGFR3 P250R and P252R mutations cause Muenke <lb/>syndrome, an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by uni-<lb/>or bi-coronal synostosis, macrocephaly, midfacial hypoplasia, and <lb/>developmental delay. 144 Some TD patients exhibit joint fusion and <lb/>craniosynostoses. 145 FGFR3 with R621H substitution in the <lb/>tyrosine kinase domain and a homozygous missense mutation-<lb/>T546K, leading to partial loss of FGFR3 function, cause campto-<lb/>dactyly, tall stature, and hearing loss syndrome. 146,147 To date, no <lb/>mutation of FGFR4 has been found responsible for genetic skeletal <lb/>disorders in humans. <lb/>FGF/FGFR signaling in skeleton development and homeostasis <lb/>Accumulating studies dissecting the roles of FGFs/FGFRs in the <lb/>development and homeostasis of skeleton have been carried out <lb/>by using animal models and cell/tissue culture systems. <lb/>FGFs in skeleton development and homeostasis.

			<body>high molecular weight (HMW FGF2) and secreted low molecular <lb/>weight (LMW FGF2) isoforms have been well clarified. The HMW <lb/>FGF2 has an inhibitory effect on bone mineralization, while the <lb/>LMW FGF2 promotes bone formation through the regulation of <lb/>Wnt, BMP2, FGF23, and phosphate homeostasis. 152,153 In the <lb/>articular cartilage, FGF2 binds to perlecan in the pericellular matrix <lb/>and acts as a mechanotransducer. 154 Full-length FGF2 or LMW <lb/>FGF2 ablation in mice leads to early onset of osteoarthritis (OA), <lb/>whereas loss of HMW FGF2 isoform has a protective effect on the <lb/>articular cartilage. 155 FGF2 can upregulate the transcription of <lb/>matrix metallopeptidases 1 and 13 (MMP1 and MMP13), stimulate <lb/>ADAMTS 5 expression, 156-158 and accelerate matrix degradation <lb/>via a neuro-endocrine pathway in human adult articular chon-<lb/>drocytes. 159 FGF3 together with BMP signaling regulates the <lb/>specification of neural crest and the extension of anterior-<lb/>posterior axis. 160 FGF signaling (FGF3 and FGF8a) together with <lb/>SHH hierarchically regulates the early specification of skull in <lb/>zebrafish. 161 FGF4 has been shown to be involved in the <lb/>development and axial elongation of embryonic murine 162,163 <lb/>and Kratochwil et al. 164 concluded that FGF4 is a direct target of <lb/>Wnt signaling during tooth development in mice. FGF6 signaling <lb/>transduction is mainly mediated by FGFR1 (osteoblasts and <lb/>osteoclasts) and FGFR4 (osteogenic precursor cells and osteo-<lb/>blasts), which can activate RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear <lb/>factor-κB (NF-κB)) to stimulate osteoclasts. 165 FGF8 participates <lb/>the regulation of osteogenic and chondrogenic fate in mesench-<lb/>ymal cells in the skull and hard palate. 166,167 Hung et al. 105 <lb/>revealed that FGF9 can promote the hypertrophy of chondro-<lb/>cytes and regulate vascularization in growth plates. Transgenic <lb/>overexpression of FGF9 in mouse chondrocytes led to decreased <lb/>proliferation and terminal differentiation of chondrocytes, which <lb/>mimics the phenotype of ACH. 104 FGF9 is required for the normal <lb/>expression of Gdf5 in the prospective joints through the <lb/>regulation of Gdf5 promoter activity. 168 FGF10 is present in the <lb/>osteoprogenitors in condensation region of the frontal bone, and <lb/>genetic knockdown (KD) of FGF10 can partially rescue the <lb/>skeletal phenotype such as craniosynostosis and sternal abnorm-<lb/>ality in AS mouse model. 169 FGF11 is involved in the simulation of <lb/>osteoclast-mediated bone resorption induced by hypoxia. 170 <lb/>FGF17 can inhibit the proliferation of FGFR3-expressing rat <lb/>chondrosarcoma chondrocytes. 107 FGF18-deficient mice show <lb/>delayed suture closure with decreased proliferation and delayed <lb/>osteogenic differentiation of calvaria osteogenic mesenchymal <lb/>cells, and increased proliferation and differentiation of chon-<lb/>drocytes, indicating that FGF18 positively regulates proliferation <lb/>and differentiation during osteogenesis, while acts negatively in <lb/>chondrogenesis. 171,172 It has been reported that the deformities <lb/>of the calvaria, ribs, hindlimb, forelimb, and axis in mice with <lb/>mesenchyme-specific FGF18 inactivation are dependent on the <lb/>expression of FGF18 originating from the mesenchymal compart-<lb/>ment. 108 Serum FGF21 concentration is positively correlated with <lb/>lumbar BMD. 173 FGF21 can lead to growth attenuation by <lb/>antagonizing the stimulatory effects of growth hormone and <lb/>even directly suppress the proliferation and differentiation of <lb/>chondrocytes in the growth plate. 174 FGF21 can enhance the <lb/>osteogenic effect of BMP2. 175 In addition, FGF21 is essential for <lb/>lactation-induced skeletal changes. 176 Transgenic mice with <lb/>overexpression of FGF23 exhibit short stature, lower extremity <lb/>deformities, and osteomalacia with low serum phosphate <lb/>concentration. 177 Conversely, FGF23-deficient mice exhibit hyper-<lb/>phosphatemia, ectopic mineralization, and poorly formed skele-<lb/>ton with an extremely low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and <lb/>elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ) level in the <lb/>serum. 178 FGF23 can suppress chondrocyte proliferation through <lb/>suppression on IHH expression. 179,180 FGF23 secreted from <lb/>osteocytes may regulate mineralization through FGFR3 in a <lb/>1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and Klotho-independent manner via an autocrine/ <lb/>paracrine feedback loop. 181 <lb/>FGFRs in skeletal development and homeostasis. The roles of <lb/>FGFRs in skeletal development and especially in genetic skeletal <lb/>diseases have been further dissected by employing genetically <lb/>modified animal models. <lb/>Zhou et al. 182 found that mice carrying a P252R mutation in <lb/>FGFR1 can mimic human PS with premature fusions of multiple <lb/>sutures, accelerated osteoblast proliferation, and increased <lb/>expressions of osteogenic genes, and further uncovered that <lb/>CBFA1 may be a downstream target of FGF/FGFR1 signals in vitro. <lb/>Trokovic et al. 183 concluded that FGFR1 is expressed in pharyngeal <lb/>region and create a permissive environment for neural crest cell <lb/>migration in mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of FGFR1 <lb/>with craniofacial defects. The hush puppy FGFR1 W691R mutation <lb/>is unresponsive to FGF1 in calcium mobilization and downstream <lb/>signaling through MAPK or PLCγ and can lead to ear defects and <lb/>skull abnormalities in mice. 184 By deletion of FGFR1 in <lb/>osteochondro-progenitor cells and differentiated osteoblasts in <lb/>mice, it is proposed that FGFR1 promotes the differentiation of <lb/>mesenchymal progenitors into osteoblasts, but inhibits the <lb/>maturation and mineralization of osteoblasts. 112 Mice lacking <lb/>FGFR1 in chondrocytes showed shortened stature and tibial length <lb/>with expanded hypertrophic zone in growth plate, indicating the <lb/>important role of FGFR1 during chondrocyte maturation. 185 <lb/>FGFR1 signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes is required for <lb/>the survival of osteocytes and bone mass maintaining in mice. 186 <lb/>In addition, our group revealed that FGFR1 can positively regulate <lb/>the differentiation and resorption activity of osteoclasts. 187 <lb/>GOF mutation in FGFR2 (S252W) resulted in increased apoptosis <lb/>of osteogenic cells, 188 disturbed osteoblastic proliferation and <lb/>differentiation, and the presence of ectopic cartilage at the <lb/>midline sagittal suture. 189 We observed that FGFR2-P253R <lb/>mutation can directly affect both intramembranous and endo-<lb/>chondral ossification in mice. 190,191 Cells isolated from limbs of <lb/>mice with FGFR2 S252W mutation can differentiate into chon-<lb/>drocytes in the osteogenic medium, suggesting that FGFR2 may <lb/>affect the fate of mesenchymal cells. 189 Further studies on BBDS <lb/>resulting from FGFR2 mutations revealed that nuclear FGFR2 <lb/>regulates the developing limb, musculoskeletal integration, and <lb/>cell fate determination. 96,192 Targeted disruption of FGFR2IIIc in <lb/>mice leads to narrowed proliferative and hypertrophic zones in <lb/>growth plate, and disturbed ossification with downregulation of <lb/>IHH, PTHRP, and RUNX2. 17 Yu et al. 193 found that conditional <lb/>deletion of FGFR2 in mesenchyme can lead to skeletal dwarfism <lb/>and decreased bone mineral density with dramatically disturbed <lb/>proliferation of osteoprogenitors and anabolic function of mature <lb/>osteoblasts in mice. In zebrafish, FGFR2 is essential for the <lb/>mesenchyme condensation, later chondrogenic differentiation, <lb/>and survival of chondrocytes in late cranial cartilage develop-<lb/>ment. 194 <lb/>Mice with FGFR3 mutation mimicking human ACH and TD II <lb/>exhibit dome-shaped skulls and chondrodysplasia, 195,196 while <lb/>FGFR3 deficiency in mice causes increased bone length, 197,198 <lb/>indicating that FGFR3 is a negative regulator of endochondral <lb/>bone formation. The expression levels of P16, P19, and P21 are <lb/>upregulated in growth plates of ACH mice and FGF2 treatment <lb/>can stimulate the expressions of P21 and P27 in RCS cells, 195,199,200 <lb/>suggesting that the upregulation of cell-cycle inhibitors may be <lb/>involved in activated FGFR3-induced growth arrest of chondro-<lb/>cytes. FGFR3 downregulates PTH/PTHrP (PTH-related peptide) <lb/>signaling partially through the Janus kinase/STAT pathway. 201-203 <lb/>Reduced telomerase activity may participate in the inhibitory <lb/>effect of FGFR3 on the proliferation of chondrocytes. 204 There are <lb/>contradictories about the role of FGFR3 in the differentiation of <lb/>chondrocytes. FGFR3 deficiency in mice causes enhanced chon-<lb/>drocyte hypertrophy; 197,198 activated FGFR3 inhibits the hyper-<lb/>trophic differentiation of chondrocytes in cultured metatarsals. <lb/>However, Minina et al. 20 revealed that FGFR3 signaling can <lb/>accelerate the hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes in <lb/></body>

			<body>cultured limbs. 195 It has also been reported that FGFR3 promotes <lb/>the terminal hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes partially <lb/>through MAPK. 20,205 Activation of endogenous FGFR3 by <lb/>FGF2 stimulation leads to reversible premature senescence of <lb/>RCS cells. 206 FGFR3 inhibits the synthesis of chondrocyte ECM such <lb/>as aggrecan and collagen 2 199,207 and promotes the degradation <lb/>of ECM via stimulation of several MMPs, including MMPs 3, 9, 10, <lb/>and 13 in chondrocytes, as a negative regulator of ECM. 208 <lb/>FGFR3 signaling is involved in macroautophagy of growth plate <lb/>chondrocytes, which is important for the postnatal skeleton <lb/>development. 209,210 Recently, it was found that activated muta-<lb/>tions of FGFR3 result in long bone defects potentially due to the <lb/>dysfunction of primary cilia, including shortened length, reduced <lb/>IFT20 trafficking, and aberrant HH signaling, 211,212 suggesting that <lb/>FGFs/FGFR3 may be involved in the function of primary cilia. <lb/>Furthermore, FGFR3 directly and indirectly regulates the osteo-<lb/>genesis process. Mice carrying FGFR3 P244R mutation display <lb/>thinning cortical bone and decreased bone mineral density in <lb/>long bones. 213 Our group found that FGFR3 can stimulate the <lb/>osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. 115 Mugniery et al. 214 revealed <lb/>that FGFR3 from disorganized growth plate has a direct effect and <lb/>an indirect effect on osteoblasts. Activation of FGFR3 in <lb/>chondrocytes leads to premature closure of synchondrosis with <lb/>enhanced osteoblastic differentiation through upregulation of the <lb/>BMPs messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and downregulation of <lb/>BMP antagonist. 215 Consistently, FGFR3 deficiency in chondrocytes <lb/>promotes osteogenesis by stimulating differentiation and miner-<lb/>alization of osteoblasts through upregulation of IHH, BMP2, BMP4, <lb/>BMP7, WNT4, and TGF-β1, and downregulation of NOGGIN <lb/>expression. 216 Both FGFR3 deficiency and constitutively activation <lb/>lead to osteopenia and perturbed bone mineralization accom-<lb/>panied with changed osteoclastic activity, 115,217 while FGFR3 has a <lb/>direct positive effect on osteoclastic bone resorption. 218 <lb/>In general, FGFR1-3 all play critical roles in both chondrogenesis <lb/>and osteogenesis, but FGFR3 is relatively more important in <lb/>chondrogenesis. <lb/>The role of FGF signaling in skeleton repair <lb/>Accumulating evidences have supported the crucial roles of FGFs/ <lb/>FGFRs in the injury repair of skeleton, including both cartilage <lb/>and bone. <lb/>Endogenous FGF signaling in skeleton injury repair <lb/>Injury and degeneration of cartilage: Cartilage is an essential part <lb/>of the skeleton. Growth plate is critical for the growth of long <lb/>bone, while the articular cartilage provides smooth and low-<lb/>friction interaction between the bones of joints. <lb/>Growth plate is fragile in growing skeleton. Given the role of <lb/>FGF signaling in growth plate, it may play potential role in growth <lb/>plate injuries. However, the roles of FGF signaling in growth plate <lb/>injuries and healing is largely unknown. In young rat growth plate <lb/>injury model, FGF2 is expressed in fibrogenic response phase and <lb/>osteogenic stage coinciding with mesenchymal cell infiltration <lb/>and bony bridge formation, suggesting the possible involvement <lb/>of FGF2 in the repair of injured growth plates. 219 In addition, FGF2 <lb/>is involved in the regulatory role of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) <lb/>in injured growth plates 220 and contributes to the pathogenesis of <lb/>osteoradionecrosis, osteopenia, and growth arrest. 221 <lb/>OA is a degenerative disease affecting mainly the articular <lb/>cartilage. Human adult articular chondrocytes express FGFR1-4 <lb/>with evident higher levels of FGFR1 and FGFR3, while the <lb/>expression levels of FGFs/FGFRs were altered in the articular <lb/>cartilage of OA patients. 222 In human osteoarthritic chondrocytes, <lb/>FGFR1 expression is increased with a concomitant suppression of <lb/>FGFR3 expression. 223 In murine models, disruption of FGFR1 in <lb/>adult articular cartilage can delay the cartilage degeneration <lb/>progression with downregulation of MMP13. 224 ACH individuals <lb/>resulting from FGFR3 GOF mutation exhibit a lower incidence of <lb/>OA. 225 Consistent with this, we revealed that FGFR3 delays OA <lb/>progression in the knee joints and temporomandibular joints <lb/>partially through downregulation of IHH in both spontaneous and <lb/>surgically induced OA models in mice. 226,227 Recently, we revealed <lb/>that FGFR3 deficiency enhances the chemotaxis of macrophages <lb/>via upregulating CXCR7, exacerbating the destruction of synovial <lb/>joints. 228 Both FGFs 1 and 2 are associated with radiographic <lb/>phenotypes of knee OA at early phase. 229 FGF1 is considered as a <lb/>catabolic factor through down-regulating of CCN2 by interaction <lb/>and enhancing the degradation of cartilaginous ECM by <lb/>MMP13. 230 FGF2 has both beneficial and deleterious effects on <lb/>articular cartilage. In human articular chondrocytes, FGF2 can <lb/>accelerate matrix degradation via a neuro-endocrine pathway 159 <lb/>and stimulation of ADAMTS5 expression through upregulating the <lb/>transcription of c-FOS/AP1 and CBFA1. 231 On the contrary, FGF2 <lb/>can promote the expression of TIMP1 (tissue inhibitor of <lb/>metalloproteinases 1) and suppress interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induced <lb/>aggrecanase activity. 232,233 Ablation of full-length FGF2 in mice <lb/>accelerates the development of spontaneous and surgically <lb/>induced OA. 155 Deletion of LMW FGF2 isoform can accelerate <lb/>murine OA, while loss of HMW FGF2 isoforms plays a protective <lb/>role. 234 Elevated FGF23 is involved in the role of HMW FGF2 in OA <lb/>development by modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. 235 FGF8 <lb/>promotes the degradation of cartilage, leading to exacerbation of <lb/>OA through enhancing the production of protease MMP3 and <lb/>prostaglandin E2 produced by the injured synovium. 236 We <lb/>revealed that the expression of FGF9 is decreased with aging. 237 <lb/>Ellsworth et al. 238 showed that FGF18 can act as an anabolic factor <lb/>in cultured articular chondrocytes through stimulating collagen 2, <lb/>proteoglycan accumulation, and chondrocyte proliferation. <lb/>Bone regeneration: Multiple studies have demonstrated that <lb/>FGFs and FGFRs recapitulate their expression pattern in skeleton <lb/>development during fracture healing process. In rat closed <lb/>femoral fracture model, FGFR1 and FGFR2 have similar expression <lb/>pattern; they are expressed in inflammatory cells, periosteal cells, <lb/>chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts in fracture callus during <lb/>both endochondral and intramembranous bone formation pro-<lb/>cesses. 239,240 The expression of FGFR3 is existed in mesenchymal <lb/>cells, prehypertrophic, and hypertrophic chondrocytes in the <lb/>fracture callus at a relative later stage. 240-242 In mouse long bone <lb/>fracture model, FGFs 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 16-18 are expressed <lb/>throughout the healing process: 243 FGFs 1, 2, and 5 are mainly <lb/>expressed at inflammatory stage; FGFs 16 and 18 peak at <lb/>endochondral bone formation phase; FGF2, 9, 16, and 18 are <lb/>highly expressed, while FGF1 and 17 show peak expression at the <lb/>bony callus formation and remodeling stage. FGF1 expression is <lb/>increased during the formation of a cartilaginous callus in <lb/>fracture, 244 especially in fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells. 245 In <lb/>rat femoral distraction osteogenesis model, the expression of FGF2 <lb/>was detected in fibrous mesenchymal cells, immature <lb/>osteoblastic-like cells, and the periosteum adjacent to the areas <lb/>of chondroid tissues. 246 <lb/>Skeletal phenotypes in mice with genetically modifying FGFs/ <lb/>FGFRs and the expression patterns of FGFs/FGFRs during fracture <lb/>healing indicate the indispensable function of FGF signaling in <lb/>bone regeneration. The SNPs of FGFR1 are associated with fracture <lb/>nonunion. 247 We found that mice with FGFR2 GOF mutation <lb/>(P253R) have enhanced bone formation induced by mechanical <lb/>ablation of long bone marrow via upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin <lb/>signaling. 248 Our group using murine tibia fracture model reveal <lb/>that FGFR3 plays a negative role in bone repairing through its <lb/>regulation of both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. 242,249,250 In <lb/>addition, FGFR3 inhibits the remodeling of injured tissue after <lb/>cortical injury through downregulation of osteoclastic resorp-<lb/>tion. 218 FGF1 may promote bone repair by inhibiting adipogenic <lb/>differentiation and increasing the number of osteoblasts in the <lb/>inflammatory environment. 251,252 Using transgenic mice, Hurley&apos;s <lb/></body>

			<body>group proved that LMW FGF2 accelerates the tibia fracture healing <lb/>process through promoting chondrocyte and osteoblast differ-<lb/>entiation and vascular invasion, and enhances the calvaria defect <lb/>healing through canonical Wnt signaling. 253,254 There is a strong <lb/>positive association between plasma FGF21 levels and BMD in <lb/>healthy women, 255 although FGF21 promotes bone loss in <lb/>mice. 256 The serum FGF23 level may be a predictor of reduction <lb/>of trabecular parameter and an indicator of nonunion. 257-259 <lb/>Application of FGF signaling modulators in skeleton repairment <lb/>Degeneration and injury of cartilage: FGFR1 promotes, while <lb/>FGFR3 suppresses OA pathogenesis, suggesting that antagonists <lb/>or neutralizing antibodies of FGFR1, and agonists or FGFs with <lb/>high binding affinity for FGFR3, could be valuable therapeutics for <lb/>OA. We revealed that pharmacologically antagonizing FGFR1 can <lb/>alleviate OA progression in surgically induced mouse OA model <lb/>and the osteoarthritic phenotype of cultured cartilage <lb/>explants. 260,261 As a high-affinity FGF ligand for FGFR3, exogenous <lb/>FGF9 can attenuate cartilage degradation while aggravate <lb/>osteophyte formation in murine post-traumatic OA model. 237 In <lb/>animal experiments, FGF18 has been repeatedly shown to have <lb/>beneficial effects on OA and improve the healing of cartilage. 262-<lb/>264 To date, recombinant human FGF18 (rhFGF18) (trade name <lb/>sprifermin) is the only FGF-based drug in clinical trials for OA. <lb/>Clinic trial data show that intraarticular application of FGF18 can <lb/>increase cartilage thickness and reduce cartilage loss without <lb/>discernible local or systemic safety concerns. 265-268 Exogenous <lb/>FGF2 can enhance the repair of articular cartilage defect <lb/>in vivo. 153,269,270 FGF2 has also been used in combination with <lb/>mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells to improve epiphyses <lb/>repair. 271,272 Due to the anabolic effect of FGF8 in the degradation <lb/>of cartilage ECM, neutralizing antibody against FGF8 can partially <lb/>alleviate the OA progression. 236 <lb/>Bone regeneration: Compared with the intervention of FGFRs, <lb/>modulations of FGF signaling by ligands are closer to the clinical <lb/>application. At present, more studies have been conducted on the <lb/>application of exogenous FGFs in bone defect conditions. 273,274 <lb/>FGF1 in a sponge carrier has shown efficacy for bone <lb/>regeneration as evidenced by more volume of new bone <lb/>formation in rat critically sized cranial defect model. 275 FGF1 with <lb/>the fibrin carrier can promote bone regeneration of critically sized <lb/>radial defect in rabbits. 276 Kawaguchi et al. 277 revealed that FGF2 <lb/>in gelatin hydrogel could accelerate radiographic bone union of a <lb/>surgical osteotomy in a dose-dependent manner, and promote <lb/>tibial-shaft fracture repair with a safety profile in humans. 278 FGF2 <lb/>promotes the repair of bone injury mainly via inducing <lb/>angiogenesis and enhancing the proliferation ability of osteo-<lb/>blastic lineage. However, the effect of FGF2 on bone formation <lb/>in vivo is biphasic, with high-dose FGF2 having no stimulatory <lb/>effect or inhibitory function. Sakano et al. 279 found that injection <lb/>of FGF2 (1 μg) markedly reduced the size of bone, and FGF2 <lb/>completely inhibited ossification at a dose of 10 μg, during <lb/>heterotopic bone formation induced by bone matrix powder <lb/>implanted in murine hamstring muscles, indicating the inhibitory <lb/>effect of FGF2 at a high dose on bone formation in vivo. Similar <lb/>results have also acquired in a murine model putting collagen <lb/>mini-pellet containing FGF2 into subperiosteal pouch, and in <lb/>transosseous rat mandibular defects. 280 Local delivery of FGF7 can <lb/>enhance bone formation in rat mandible defects with enhanced <lb/>osteogenesis and chemoattraction. 281 Calvaria defects in either <lb/>FGF9 or FGF18 haploinsufficiency mice showed impaired healing, <lb/>which could be rescued by exogenous FGF ligands. FGF9-soaked <lb/>collagen sponge causes sufficient bone regeneration in 2-mm <lb/>diameter calvaria bone defects at postnatal day 7. 282 Deletion of <lb/>one FGF18 allele can markedly reduce long bone regeneration <lb/>with dramatic impairment of neovascularization, osteoclast <lb/>recruitment, and bone remodeling, and treatment with FGF18 <lb/>protein rescued the disturbed healing capacity. 283 FGF18 applica-<lb/>tion together with BMP2 can stabilize BMP2-dependent bone <lb/>regeneration of 3-mm diameter critical-sized bone defects in <lb/>mouse calvarium. 284 Kang et al. 285 established FGF2-FGF18-loaded <lb/>fiber scaffolds to release FGF2 and FGF18 in a sequential manner, <lb/>and found that it is effective for bone regeneration in rat <lb/>calvarium defect model. <lb/>Our knowledge of the complicated roles and mechanisms of <lb/>FGF signaling in bone regeneration is limited. The precise role of <lb/>individual FGFs and FGFRs in individual cell lineage at different <lb/>stages during fracture healing and bone regeneration, the <lb/>application dose, timing and duration of FGFs, and its combination <lb/>with other bone-modulating signaling molecules, novel vectors <lb/>and protein delivery systems, need to be further explored to <lb/>effectively promote bone regeneration and achieve better clinical <lb/>applications. <lb/>FGF SIGNALING IN LUNG DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASES <lb/>The mammalian lung is derived through a series of epithelial <lb/>branching events, leading to a complex branched airways and <lb/>blood vessels, which eventually form a fully functioning air <lb/>exchange organ. Lung development can be morphologically <lb/>divided into several stages that correspond to key developmental <lb/>transitions: the embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, <lb/>and alveolar stages. 286 In chronological order, these stages involve <lb/>endoderm induction, anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral pat-<lb/>terning, lung specification, lung budding, branching morphogen-<lb/>esis, and finally maturation. <lb/>Expressions of FGF ligands and receptors in the lung <lb/>The expressions of FGF ligands and receptors have been found <lb/>during lung development. Using in situ hybridization and RNA-<lb/>sequencing, Danopoulos et al. 287 assessed the expressions and <lb/>distribution of FGF ligands in the cultured human fetal lung. It is <lb/>demonstrated that the expression of FGF7 is in both the <lb/>epithelium and mesenchyme; FGF9 is mainly expressed in the <lb/>distal epithelium, while FGF10 is diffusely expressed throughout <lb/>the parenchyma, and some expression of FGF10 is found in the <lb/>smooth muscle cells (SMCs). FGFR2 is highly expressed in <lb/>proximal, distal epithelial cells, and SMCs. FGFR3 is mostly <lb/>expressed in the epithelial cells, and expressed lower in the <lb/>mesenchyme, while FGFR4 is highly expressed in the mesench-<lb/>yme and distal epithelium. The expressions of FGF ligands and <lb/>FGFRs (FGFR1-4) also have been reported in the developing <lb/>rodent lung. 288,289 <lb/>Roles of FGF/FGFR signaling during lung development <lb/>FGF/FGFR signaling is essential for lung development. <lb/>FGF1 stimulates lung epithelial cell proliferation and airway bud <lb/>formation, and FGF7 causes cell proliferation in vitro inducing the <lb/>formation of cysts from epithelia. 290 Transgenic mice overexpres-<lb/>sing FGF7 exhibit lung malformation. 291 During the early phase of <lb/>lung development, FGF9 controls epithelial branching and <lb/>mesenchymal proliferation. 292 Deletion or overexpression of <lb/>FGF9 results in branching defects in mice with disturbance of <lb/>the HH and Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the expressions of FGF10 <lb/>and BMP4. 293-295 FGF10 expression is drastically decreased in <lb/>FGF9-deficient lungs from E14.5 onwards, 296 and in FGF9-<lb/>overexpressing lung, BMP4 expression is increasingly expressed <lb/>in the proximal and distal airway epithelium, whereas FGF10 <lb/>expression is upregulated locally in the distal mesenchyme. 293 <lb/>Deletion of FGF10 results in complete distal lung agenesis. 297,298 In <lb/>cultured human fetal lung both FGF7 and FGF10 can induce liquid <lb/>secretion and enlargement in distal tips. 299,300 Using in vitro <lb/>organoid cultures from the distal tip epithelium of human <lb/>embryonic lung at pseudoglandular stage, Nikolic et al. 301 have <lb/>revealed that FGF10 is not required for the initial establishment of <lb/></body>

			<body>SOX2 + /SOX9 + progenitors and for human lung branching. A <lb/>recent study shows that foregut spheroids treated with high levels <lb/>of FGF10 and 1% fetal bovine serum can form human lung <lb/>organoids containing airway-like structures, mesenchymal cells, <lb/>and alveolar epithelial cell type I and type II markers. 302 FGF18 <lb/>plays a role in lung alveolar development during late embryonic <lb/>lung development. FGF18 knockout mice show narrow alveolar <lb/>space, thick interstitial mesenchymal compartments, and more <lb/>embedded capillaries. 303 Blocking the function of FGFR2 by a <lb/>dominant-negative mutation results in blocked airway branching <lb/>and epithelial differentiation. 304 Mice deficient in both FGFR3 and <lb/>FGFR4 show failure of alveogenesis, but deletion of either receptor <lb/>alone does not disrupt lung development. 305,306 A recent in vivo <lb/>study demonstrated that FGFR3 and FGFR4 in mesenchymal cells <lb/>have a function to control the organization of postnatal alveolar <lb/>elastin, thereby driving the formation of alveolar septa for <lb/>increasing the gas-exchange surface. 289 <lb/>Roles of FGF/FGFR signaling in lung diseases <lb/>SNPs and mutations of FGFs/FGFRs in human lung diseases. <lb/>Genetic analysis has found that SNPs in FGFs are associated with <lb/>various types of lung diseases. SNPs in FGF10 may be associated <lb/>with susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <lb/>(COPD). 307 FGF10 SNPs are also associated with airway branch <lb/>variants. 308 SNPs in FGF3, FGF7, and FGFR4 are associated with <lb/>respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). FGFR4 (rs1966265) is also <lb/>associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the common <lb/>chronic lung disease of premature birth. 309 Besides, mutations in <lb/>FGFs and FGFRs also have been found in human lung diseases. <lb/>Mutations in FGF10, FGFR2, or FGFR3 have been identified in LADD <lb/>(lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital) patients. 124,310 Rare FGF10 muta-<lb/>tions have been identified in lethal pulmonary hypoplasia. 311 <lb/>Defects in the formation of tracheal cartilaginous ring resulting in <lb/>mortality, resulting from respiratory distress, have been reported in <lb/>Crouzon, AS, and PS caused by activating mutations of FGFR2. 312-314 <lb/>Homozygous loss-of-function mutation (R255Q) of FGFR2 contri-<lb/>butes to ectrodactyly and pulmonary acinar dysplasia. 315 All these <lb/>findings suggest the crucial roles of FGF signaling in lung diseases. <lb/>Abnormal expressions of FGFs/FGFRs in lung diseases. In human <lb/>fetal congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, the epithelial <lb/>FGF9 expression is 4-fold higher than that of normal fetal lung, <lb/>whereas FGF10 and FGFR2 gene expressions have no change in <lb/>the lung mesenchyme. 316 Reduced FGF10 expression has been <lb/>shown in BPD. 317 FGF18 expression is decreased in hypoplastic <lb/>lungs from patients harboring congenital diaphragmatic hernia <lb/>(CDH). 318 Plasma FGF23 levels is significantly elevated in COPD <lb/>patients. 312 FGF1/FGFR signaling is aberrantly increased in <lb/>idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and may lead to the <lb/>pathogenesis of lung fibrosis by promoting fibroblast migration <lb/>via increased MAPK signaling. 319 <lb/>Regulation of FGF/FGFR signaling in lung diseases using in vivo and <lb/>in vitro models. Studies in rodent models and in vitro lung cells <lb/>have further implicated the roles of FGF signaling pathway in lung <lb/>diseases. In lung of CDH rat, FGF7 and FGF10 gene expressions are <lb/>decreased significantly compared with controls. 320 Studies using <lb/>rat <lb/>doxorubicin-induced <lb/>EA-TEF <lb/>(esophageal <lb/>atresia-<lb/>tracheoesophageal fistula) model have found that disturbed <lb/>FGF10/CTSH signaling is associated with impaired airway branch-<lb/>ing and consequent impairment of epithelial cells in the lung. 321 <lb/>BPD model established by exposing newborn mice to sublethal <lb/>hyperoxia shows decreased expressions of FGFR3 and FGFR4. 322 <lb/>Klotho knockout mice show COPD and airway inflammation with <lb/>elevated FGFR4 in the lung, whereas airway inflammation was <lb/>attenuated in mice with overexpression of klotho. 312 FGF9 and <lb/>FGF18 promote survival and migration of human lung fibroblasts <lb/>from patients with IPF, and inhibit myofibroblast differentiation of <lb/>human lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF. 323 Recent studies <lb/>have demonstrated that alveolar type 2 stem cells are maintained <lb/>by FGF10-FGFR2B signaling. Loss of FGF10-FGFR2B signaling in <lb/>bronchial epithelial cells leads to impaired generation of both neo-<lb/>basal cells and alveolar epithelial cells after bleomycin injury, <lb/>which can cause IPF. 324 Deletion of FGFRs (FGFR1, 2, and 3) in lung <lb/>mesenchyme decreases pulmonary fibrosis development in <lb/>response to bleomycin. 325 FGF7 and FGF10 can improve the lung <lb/>repair and increase the epithelial survival after injury through <lb/>FGFR2b signaling in rodents. FGF10 can also increase lung-<lb/>resident mesenchymal stem cells and reduce the inflammatory <lb/>response after acute lung injury (ALI). 326 FGF10 has preventive <lb/>roles in alveolar repair and resolution in ALI or acute RDS. 327 <lb/>FGF/FGFR signaling as a target for the therapies of lung diseases <lb/>FGF/FGFR signaling represents a privileged target for the <lb/>therapeutic approach. Therapeutics targeting FGF signaling path-<lb/>ways are largely classified into &quot;pro-FGF signaling&quot; and &quot;anti-FGF <lb/>signaling&quot; therapeutics. Recombinant FGFs or FGF analogs have <lb/>been developed as pro-FGF signaling therapeutics to improve the <lb/>beneficial effects of FGF signaling. On the other hand, tyrosine <lb/>kinase inhibitors (TKIs), anti-FGFR antibodies or peptides, and FGF <lb/>traps have been found as approaches aimed to block FGF <lb/>signaling. 328 A TKI, Nintedanib, which targets FGFRs 1-3, PDGF <lb/>receptors α/β, and VEGF receptors 1-3, has been approved in the <lb/>USA and the EU to treat IPF. 329 Recent studies found that FGF1 <lb/>may have preventative and therapeutic effects on transforming <lb/>growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced pulmonary fibrosis through <lb/>inducing AEC proliferation, inhibiting myofibroblast differentia-<lb/>tion, regulating TGF-β1 signaling, and FGFR1 expression. Thus, <lb/>modulating FGF1 signaling may be a potential therapeutic <lb/>strategy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. 330 Considering <lb/>that FGF2 acts as an angiogenic mediator involved in various lung <lb/>disorders such as COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hyperten-<lb/>sion, asthma, and lung cancer, FGF2 could also be an crucial target <lb/>for the treatment of these lung disorders. 331 FGF7 stimulates <lb/>proliferation of lung epithelial cells and has been considered as a <lb/>potential therapy for lung injury. 332 FGF9 is a strong candidate <lb/>contributing to the progression of IPF, which makes it a potential <lb/>target for the therapies of IPF. 323 Because of its important roles in <lb/>lung development and diseases, FGF10 becomes an intriguing <lb/>target for preventing and treating lung diseases. <lb/>However, FGF family is comprised of various ligands and <lb/>receptors with multiple effects on different cell types in the lung, <lb/>limiting the potential therapeutic efficacy. For instance, in contrast <lb/>to its anti-fibrotic effect in TGF-β1-induced lung fibrosis, FGF1 and <lb/>FGFR1-4 are also expressed increasingly in IPF lungs, and FGF1 <lb/>treatment led to decreased collagen production and increased <lb/>apoptosis of IPF-derived lung fibroblasts, suggesting that FGF1 <lb/>may lead to the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. 319 Recent studies <lb/>reported that FGF9 and FGF18 decreased normal fibroblast <lb/>apoptosis, but had no effect on fibroblasts from IPF patients. <lb/>FGF9, but not FGF18, decreased basal and TGF-β1-mediated <lb/>expression of collagen and myofibroblast differentiation of <lb/>fibroblasts. 323 All these studies suggest that individual members <lb/>of FGF family may exert variable effects, depending on the <lb/>responding cells and the involvement of other signalings. Thus, <lb/>investigation of specific roles of distinct FGF ligands and receptors <lb/>in different types of lung cells will help to target differential <lb/>pathways with precision and optimize the efficacy of future <lb/>therapies for patients with lung diseases. <lb/>FGF SIGNALING IN URINARY SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND <lb/>DISEASES <lb/>Expression pattern of FGFs /FGFRs in kidney development <lb/>The metanephric kidney develops from nephrogenic cord and <lb/>Wolffian (nephric) duct, which then generate ureteric bud (UB) <lb/></body>

			<body>and the metanephric mesenchyme (MM), respectively. 333 FGFR1-4 <lb/>and FGFs are highly expressed in mammalian embryonic kidney <lb/>and lower urinary tract and play critical roles in the development <lb/>of kidney. Although all FGFRs were detected in embryonic kidneys, <lb/>FGFR3 or FGFR4 global knockout mice does not show significant <lb/>structural defects of the kidney or bladder, 198,306 which indicates <lb/>that FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFRL1 play more necessary roles in <lb/>kidney development. FGFR1 is mainly expressed in MM lineages <lb/>(early MM, developing into nephrons starting with vesicles and <lb/>cap mesenchyme), the ureteric lineage, and renal cortical <lb/>stroma. 334-337 FGFR2 is mainly present in the Wolffian duct, the <lb/>tips and trunks of UB, and differentiating nephrons, but has fewer <lb/>expressions in early MM and stromal mesenchyme adjacent to the <lb/>Wolffian duct. 338 FGFRL1 is located in renal vesicles. 339 The <lb/>expressions of FGF 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 20 during kidney <lb/>development have been reported. 338 FGF2 can be secreted by <lb/>ureteric tips. FGF1, 7, and 10 are expressed in renal stroma. FGF8 is <lb/>mainly observed in the renal vesicle. FGF9 mostly locates in the UB <lb/>as well as in the cap mesenchyme. FGF12 only presents in the UB. <lb/>FGF20 is detected in nephron progenitors. <lb/>FGFs/FGFRs in urinary system development <lb/>FGFs/FGFRs in nephron development. Early researches in rodents <lb/>and Xenopus laevis explants have found that exogenous FGF2 can <lb/>maintain the sustained mesenchymal tissue growth and in some <lb/>conditions induce formation of epithelial nephrons. 340-342 More <lb/>definitive evidences indicate the essential roles of FGF signaling in <lb/>nephron formation. Deletion of FGF8 with either Pax3Cre 343 (in the <lb/>MM) or brachyury (T) Cre (in mesodermal) line 344 results in small <lb/>kidneys with a complete block in nephron formation after the <lb/>epithelial vesicle stage. Like the conditional FGF8 knockouts, <lb/>global deletion of FGFRL1 also leads to blockade of nephron <lb/>differentiation. 339 These data indicate that FGFRL1 might be the <lb/>candidate FGFR that binds to and mediates the effects of Fgf8 in <lb/>the nephron lineages. <lb/>FGF signaling also has positive effects on the maintenance of <lb/>nephron progenitors. Among the growth factors known to have <lb/>expression in embryonic kidney, FGF1, 2, 9, and 20 were found to <lb/>promote proliferation of nephron progenitors in vitro. 345 Global <lb/>knockout of FGF9 and FGF20 alone or together led to nephron <lb/>progenitor apoptosis and subsequent renal agenesis. 346 Exogen-<lb/>ous FGF9 or FGF20 is sufficient to maintain the stemness of MM or <lb/>sorted nephron progenitors in vitro. 346 However, FGF1 knockout <lb/>mice, alone and in combination with FGF2 knockout, have no <lb/>nephron progenitor defects, 347 and FGF2-null mice 348 have no <lb/>renal defects. Mice with double knockout of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in <lb/>Pax3-positive cells display severe defect of MM, while mice with <lb/>either FGFR1 or FGFR2 deficiency have well-developed kidneys. 335 <lb/>These results indicate that FGFR1 and FGFR2 may have a <lb/>redundant role in establishing and sustaining early MM. Condi-<lb/>tional deletion of FGFR1 and FGFR2 with Six2Cre (in nephron <lb/>progenitors) reduces Six2-positive nephron progenitors leading to <lb/>severe renal cystic dysplasia. 349 FRS2α is the main driver of FGFR <lb/>signaling through ectopically activating notch signaling in <lb/>nephron progenitors. 349 Double mutation mice, carrying the point <lb/>mutation in the FRS2α binding site of FGFR2 and conditional <lb/>deletion of FGFR1 with Pax3Cre, show nephron progenitor <lb/>depletion at later stages of development. 350 Considering the <lb/>similarity of the phenotypes in knockout mice, FGF9 and FGF20 <lb/>are the likely ligands for FGFR/FRS2α in nephron development. <lb/>FGFs/FGFRs in ureteric branching and induction. FGF7 and FGF10 <lb/>bind to FGFR2 and regulate the growth and branching <lb/>morphogenesis of the collecting duct system. FGF7-null mice <lb/>show marked reduction in developing ureteric bud and mature <lb/>collecting system with secondary loss of nephrons. 351 Meanwhile, <lb/>FGF7 administration could augment ureteric bud growth and <lb/>increase the number of nephrons in vitro. 351 FGF10-null mice also <lb/>have smaller kidneys with fewer collecting ducts. 352 FGF7 and <lb/>FGF10 activate the b isoform of FGFR2. Consistently, mice <lb/>deficient for FGFR2-IIIb have dysgenesis of the kidney similar to <lb/>that observed in FGF7-and FGF10-null mice. 353 <lb/>Recent studies further investigated the role of FGFR1 and FGFR2 <lb/>in renal development using conditional knockout mice, since <lb/>global deficiency of FGFR1 or FGFR2 leads to embryonic lethality <lb/>prior to kidney development. Conditional loss of FGFR2 in the <lb/>Wolffian duct and its derivatives, including the ureteric bud using <lb/>Hoxb7Cre, leads to renal hypoplasia, such as small ampullary, few <lb/>ureteric branches, and thin trunks. 336,354 Furthermore, neither <lb/>knockout FGFR1 alone nor double knockout of FGFR1 and FGFR2 <lb/>with Hoxb7cre led to additional abnormalities beyond single <lb/>knockout of FGFR2. 336 Global deletion of FGFR3 or FGFR4 in mice <lb/>results in no obvious gross phenotype of kidney. 198,306 These data <lb/>together suggest that among four FGFRs, FGFR2 seems to be the <lb/>most important one regulating ureteric bud branching morpho-<lb/>genesis and stromal mesenchyme patterning. <lb/>FGF signaling in kidney diseases <lb/>FGF and human genetic kidney diseases. Some mutations in FGFs <lb/>or FGFRs in humans are associated with structural kidney and <lb/>lower urinary tract diseases. Activating mutations of FGFR1, FGFR2, <lb/>and FGFR3 lead to PS, AS, or TD. Some of these patients also have <lb/>unilateral renal aplasia, hydroureter, vesicoureteral reflux, renal <lb/>hypoplasia, and/or cystic dysplasia. 355 Patients with Kallman <lb/>syndrome due to LOF mutations in FGFR1 have unilateral renal <lb/>aplasia. Inactivating mutations of FGF20 was found to cause <lb/>bilateral renal aplasia. 346 <lb/>FGF signaling in CKD: Some endocrine FGFs (FGF21, FGF23) play <lb/>important roles in CKD. <lb/>FGF21: FGF21 binds to a complex of KLB and FGFR1c to induce <lb/>catabolic metabolism. Increased serum FGF21 levels are detected <lb/>in CKD patients as early as stage 2. 356 Since FGF21 was reported to <lb/>have anti-aging effects, increasing the levels of FGF21 might be <lb/>useful for the longevity of CKD patients. 36 However, increased <lb/>FGF21 also has many side effects. High FGF21 level can induce <lb/>growth retardation, which might be related to the growth <lb/>hormone resistance in children with CKD. 357 Overexpression of <lb/>FGF21 leads to osteopenia and increased adipogenesis in bone <lb/>marrow that may contribute to the progress of CKD-mineral and <lb/>bone disorder (CKD-MBD). 256 High FGF21 may also be involved in <lb/>the neuropsychiatric symptoms in CKD patients. Overexpression <lb/>of FGF21 in mice causes disturbed circadian rhythm that can be <lb/>rescued by specific ablation of KLB in the suprachiasmatic <lb/>nucleus. 358 Some researchers speculate that the circadian rhythm <lb/>disorder related with high FGF21 level may contribute to the <lb/>blood pressure fluctuation in CKD patients. 36 FGF21 also increases <lb/>serum corticosterone concentration that has been found to cause <lb/>depression. 359,360 Both depression and high FGF21 are associated <lb/>with high mortality in dialysis patients. 361,362 In brief, FGF21-KLB <lb/>axis could be a potential treatment target in CKD. <lb/>FGF23: FGF23 is secreted from bone tissue and binds to a <lb/>complex of α-Klotho and FGFR1c, FGFR3c, or FGFR4 in kidney as a <lb/>hormone to regulate systemic phosphate homeostasis and <lb/>vitamin D metabolism. 363 A secondary elevation of serum FGF23 <lb/>levels is commonly detected in CKD patients that are partly due to <lb/>decreased renal clearance. 364 The increased FGF23 is beneficial for <lb/>lowering serum phosphate level and reducing 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 , which <lb/>further increases the PTH level. These disturbed hormones would <lb/>lead to CKD-MBD, which causes abnormities of bone turnover, <lb/>mineralization, bone volume, extraskeletal calcification, and <lb/>increased mortality. 365 Clinical studies indicate that elevated <lb/>serum FGF23 concentrations can be used to predict kidney <lb/>disease progression, especially in the early stages of diabetic <lb/></body>

			<body>nephropathy. 366,367 However, neutralization of FGF23 with its <lb/>antibody further enhances the increased serum phosphate level <lb/>and vascular calcification that can cause increased risk of <lb/>mortality. 368 The direct role of elevated FGF23 in the cardiovas-<lb/>cular events caused by CKD should be further studied. Further-<lb/>more, increased serum FGF23 level may be a beneficial <lb/>compensatory response to maintain mineral homeostasis in early <lb/>stage of CKD. FGF23 is not only a biomarker for the diagnosis and/ <lb/>or prognosis of CKD, but also a pathogenic factor for the <lb/>progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease. Targeting the <lb/>FGF23-Klotho endocrine axes might have therapeutic benefit for <lb/>diseases of kidney in clinics. 36 Whether blocking of FGF23 <lb/>activities in patients with end-stage renal disease is an effective <lb/>therapy to improve symptoms needs to be further studied. <lb/>Recently, FGF23 has been found to regulate immune system in <lb/>CKD. Impaired immunological responses and susceptible to <lb/>infections are common in CKD patients. 369,370 Circulation FGF23 <lb/>level is correlated with incidence of infections. 371 Previous studies <lb/>suggest that FGF23 might be intimately involved in inflammatory <lb/>processes. FGF23 increases the number of macrophages and <lb/>induces the expression of TNF-α in response to inoculation with <lb/>Escherichia coli or lipopolysaccharide injection. 372 The stimulation <lb/>of TNF-α in M2 macrophages by FGF23 could be blocked by 1,25 <lb/>(OH) 2 D 3 . 373 FGF23 inhibits arginase-1 expression in M2 macro-<lb/>phages. 373 These studies suggest that FGF23 has pro-<lb/>inflammatory functions. It was further reported that FGF23 <lb/>prevented leukocyte recruitment and impaired host defense in <lb/>CKD. 374 FGF23-α-Klotho-FGFR2 axis plays a central role in this <lb/>process by activating PKA and inhibiting Rap1 that will finally <lb/>inactivate β2-integrin function. 374 FGF23 could also facilitate the <lb/>rolling of neutrophils. 374 <lb/>Fibrosis is a common feature of CKD, and involves leukocyte <lb/>recruitment, angiogenesis, blood vessel leakage, and appearance <lb/>of myofibroblasts. Secretion of FGF2 375 and FGF23 376 from <lb/>podocytes, mesangial cells, interstitial mesenchymal cells, <lb/>endothelia, or myofibroblasts was reported. FGF2 facilitates the <lb/>trans-differentiation of tubular epithelial cells to mesenchymal <lb/>cells, which accelerates the increase of matrix-producing cells. 375 <lb/>However, detailed mechanisms for the role FGF signaling in renal <lb/>fibrosis remain to be explored. <lb/>FGF signaling in kidney injury and repair. Elevated FGF23 levels in <lb/>the circulation and urine were reported in acute kidney injury (AKI) <lb/>patients by numerous studies. 377-381 Increased serum FGF23 level <lb/>has been found to be an early marker of incident AKI. In three <lb/>independent cardiac surgery cohorts, patients with AKI have <lb/>higher levels of C-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) than those who did not <lb/>develop AKI as early as cardiopulmonary bypass ending. 377,378,382 <lb/>The predictive performance of cFGF23 was higher than other <lb/>urinary injury biomarkers, including NAG (n-acetyl-b-(D)-glucosa-<lb/>minidase), KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1), and NGAL (neutrophil <lb/>gelatinase-associated lipocalin) at the end of cardiopulmonary <lb/>bypass. 377 FGF23 is also thought to be a candidate prognostic <lb/>marker for the adverse outcomes in AKI patients. Patients with the <lb/>highest quartiles of cFGF23 and intact, biologically active protein <lb/>(iFGF23) had a significantly increased risk of 60-day mortality than <lb/>those having the lowest quartiles in two cohorts of critical illness <lb/>involved AKI patients. 383 Further study is required to clarify <lb/>whether aberrant FGF23 contributes to the poor outcomes of AKI. <lb/>The mechanisms underlying the increased plasma FGF23 in AKI <lb/>are not clear. Increased production of FGF23 in osteoblasts may be <lb/>one of the major causes. Increased mRNA expressions of FGF23 in <lb/>the bone, bone marrow, and renal tissues are found in several AKI <lb/>mouse models. 384-386 This could be reversed by pretreatment with <lb/>PD173074, an FGFR inhibitor, or blocking the erythropoietin <lb/>receptor. 384,386 These results indicate that the increased circulating <lb/>erythropoietin and erythropoietin receptor activation are involved <lb/>in the mechanisms leading to increased plasma FGF23 in AKI. <lb/>Resection of the obstructed kidney had no effect on the increased <lb/>circulating iFGF23 levels, 387 excluding the possibility that produc-<lb/>tion of FGF23 by the kidneys contributes to plasma FGF23. <lb/>Considering the relevance of FGF signaling in kidney develop-<lb/>ment and diseases, there may be potential therapeutic strategies <lb/>to regulate the process of renal development and diseases by <lb/>manipulating FGF signaling. For example, recombinant FGF10 may <lb/>be useful in alleviating ureteric branching defects in Fraser <lb/>syndrome (FRAS1 mutations). 388 The requirement for <lb/>FGFR2 signaling in lower urinary tract mesenchyme 389 suggests <lb/>that FGF-related therapies could be used to repair the smooth <lb/>muscle defects in the ureter or bladder. FGF7 expression levels are <lb/>increased after chemically induced kidney injury in rats. 390 <lb/>Intravenous administration of recombinant truncated human <lb/>FGF7 largely prevented cyclophosphamide-induced urothelial <lb/>injury in rats, 391 indicating that FGF7 could be a potential therapy <lb/>for patients with bladder urothelial injury. <lb/>FGF SIGNALING IN MUSCLE AND HEART DEVELOPMENT AND <lb/>DISEASE <lb/>FGF signaling in the skeletal muscle <lb/>Adult skeletal muscle possesses remarkable regeneration capacity; <lb/>it can be rapidly repaired after the damage caused by exercise, <lb/>trauma, toxins, or diseases. 392 Satellite cells (SCs), which reside <lb/>beneath the basal lamina of muscle fibers, are considered as the <lb/>stem cells in the skeletal muscle. Normally SCs are mitotically <lb/>quiescent, but upon regeneration they are activated, and give rise <lb/>to myogenic precursors. 392 After several rounds of proliferation <lb/>and differentiation, most of these myogenic precursors form new <lb/>muscle fibers, while a small population of these cells returns to <lb/>quiescent SCs. 392 <lb/>FGFs in the skeletal muscle. FGFs are essential for the self-renewal <lb/>of SCs and are needed for skeletal muscle maintenance and <lb/>regeneration. FGF1, FGF2, FGF4, and FGF6 can be detected in <lb/>SCs. 393,394 FGF1 and FGF4 can be found in isolated myofiber <lb/>cultures and in in vivo injured adult skeletal muscle tissue. 394,395 <lb/>FGF2: FGF2 is present in the extracellular matrix and basal <lb/>lamina of skeletal muscles, 396 and is produced by fibroblasts, 397 <lb/>myofibers, 398 and SCs, 399 while the relative contribution of FGF2 to <lb/>these cells is difficult to distinguish. FGF2 has been used as a <lb/>routine medium supplement in SC primary culture. 400,401 Although <lb/>SCs from young mice (3-6 months) do not need supplementation <lb/>of FGF2 in the culture medium, SCs from geriatric mice <lb/>(29-33 months) cannot proliferate without the addition of <lb/>FGF2. 402 FGF2 is considered as a mitogen for SCs; it triggers SC <lb/>proliferation by repressing myogenesis. 403,404 However, FGF2 is <lb/>not able to stimulate cell division without serum. 405,406 Recently, it <lb/>is reported that excessive FGF2 removes age-associated prolif-<lb/>erative inhibition of SCs. 407 The upregulated expression of FGF2 in <lb/>aged muscle fibers and downregulated expression of SPRY1 in <lb/>aged SCs increase the FGF signaling under homeostatic conditions <lb/>and break the quiescence of SCs, resulting in SC depletion and <lb/>losing self-renewing capacity. 408 SPRY1, an inhibitor of FGF <lb/>signaling, is highly expressed in quiescent adult SCs in uninjured <lb/>muscle, 409 while muscle stem cell niche, the muscle fiber, <lb/>expresses FGF2 under homeostatic conditions. Spry1 is needed <lb/>for the maintenance of the endogenous adult Pax7-positive SCs in <lb/>their native environment, but it is downregulated in proliferating <lb/>myogenic progenitors in injured muscles. 410 Overexpression of <lb/>SPRY1 in SCs or inhibition of FGFR1 signaling can prevent SC <lb/>depletion. Thus, blockade of FGF2/FGFR1 signaling might be a <lb/>new therapeutic method to recover the regeneration capacity of <lb/>skeletal muscles during aging. 408 The expression of FGF2 is found <lb/>to be increased during the muscle regeneration, 398 and exogen-<lb/>ous FGF2 could promote muscle regeneration in dystrophic <lb/></body>

			<body>mice. 411 However, this effect is wiped out in FGF2-null mice, 348 <lb/>and injection of FGF-blocking antibodies also inhibits the <lb/>regeneration process. 412 <lb/>FGF6: FGF6 can be detected in both embryonic and adult <lb/>skeletal muscle tissues, 413,414 and isolated myofibers. 394 In adult <lb/>mice, FGF6 is secreted by fast-twitch fibers, and its expression is <lb/>increased after skeletal muscle injury. 415 FGF6 mainly performs its <lb/>function through binding to FGFR4. 416 Presently, the role of FGF6 <lb/>in the skeletal muscle is controversial. Interbreeding of FGF6-<lb/>deficient mutants with dystrophic mdx mice (a model for <lb/>Duchenne muscular dystrophy) results in tremendous dystrophic <lb/>changes in skeletal muscles, including degeneration of myotube, <lb/>emergence of many mononuclear cells, and collagen deposition. <lb/>MyoD mRNA is normally upregulated in mdx; however, it is not <lb/>observed in double mutant mice. 415 It is also reported that FGF6-<lb/>deficient mice show regeneration defects with myotube degen-<lb/>eration and severe fibrosis. 415 The numbers of Myo + Myogenin + <lb/>activated SCs are severely reduced in mutant mice after injury, and <lb/>which is not caused by the decreased quiescent SCs, probably by <lb/>the lack of activated SCs. 415 However, another team declared that <lb/>no skeletal muscle phenotype is found in FGF6-deficient mice, and <lb/>FGF6 might not play an essential role in muscle regeneration or its <lb/>function is compensated by other FGFs. 417 Using FGF6 global <lb/>knockout mice and rescue experiments, Armand et al. 418 found <lb/>that FGF6 is participated in soleus regeneration of adult mice in a <lb/>specific dose-dependent manner: FGF6 promotes the proliferation <lb/>of the myogenic cells at high doses, while it regulates the <lb/>differentiation of myogenic cells and muscle phenotype via a <lb/>calcineurin signaling pathway at lower doses. Genetic deletion of <lb/>FGF2 and FGF6 in mdx mice leads to much more severe dystrophic <lb/>phenotypes in FGF2/FGF6/MDX triple-mutant mice than in mdx <lb/>mice, 419 which further supports that FGF6 plays an important role <lb/>in muscle regeneration. <lb/>FGF15/19: Recently, FGF19 has been reported to have novel <lb/>function in enlarging muscle fiber size, and in protecting the <lb/>skeletal muscle from atrophy. 420 Pharmacological dosage of <lb/>FGF19 significantly increases human myotube size in vitro. 420 <lb/>Treatment of mice with FGF19 causes skeletal muscle hypertro-<lb/>phy, while genetic deletion of KLB eliminates the hypertrophic <lb/>effect of FGF19 in mice. 420 Both in vitro and in vivo, <lb/>FGF19 stimulates the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the <lb/>ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1), which is an mTOR-<lb/>dependent key regulator of muscle cell growth. 420 Studies also <lb/>found that FGF19 relieves the skeletal muscle wasting induced by <lb/>glucocorticoid, obesity, or sarcopenia in mice. Therefore, FGF19 <lb/>have the therapeutic potential for promotion of the skeletal <lb/>muscle mass and treatment of muscle wasting. 420 <lb/>FGFRs in the skeletal muscle. Among the four FGFRs, SCs express <lb/>high levels of FGFR1 and FGFR4, low levels of FGFR3, and little or <lb/>no detectable FGFR2. 404,421 However, studying the relative <lb/>contributions of the FGFRs to SCs is rather difficult, because they <lb/>usually activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways and their <lb/>functions are often compensated by each other when inhibited by <lb/>one of the FGFR. <lb/>FGFR1: FGFR1 is highly expressed in freshly isolated SCs and <lb/>myogenic cultures, and it has been considered in the context of <lb/>adult myogenesis. 394,422 FGFR1-null mice cannot gastrulate. 423,424 <lb/>Myogenic-specific (MyoDCre-driven) ablation of FGFR1 in mice <lb/>seems to have no overt effect on the histology characteristics of <lb/>muscle and the progress of muscle regeneration following <lb/>cardiotoxin-induced injury. 404 In contrast, SCs could not respond <lb/>to the stimulation of FGF2 in isolated myofibers from FGFR1-<lb/>ablated mice, 404 which suggests that other FGFRs may compen-<lb/>sate the function of FGFR1 during SC differentiation. FGFR1 <lb/>downstream signals include both ERK regulating SC prolifera-<lb/>tion 425 and p38α and p38β (p38α/β) MAPK pathways that is <lb/>involved in the exit of SCs from quiescence, 426,427 asymmetric <lb/>division of SCs, 427 and differentiation of SCs in vivo. 427 Recently, it <lb/>is reported that SCs from aged mice autonomously lose their self-<lb/>renewal ability due to alterations in FGFR1, p38α, and p38β MAPK <lb/>signaling. 428 Ectopic activation of phospho-FGFR1 partially rescues <lb/>their age-associated self-renew ability with asymmetric localiza-<lb/>tion of phospho-p38α/β MAPK in dividing SCs. 428 These results <lb/>highlight an age-associated deregulation of homeostatic network <lb/>of SCs and hints a therapeutic potential for the treatment of <lb/>muscle wasting. <lb/>FGFR4: FGFR4 is expressed in intact myofibers, muscle con-<lb/>nective tissue, isolated proliferating and differentiating SCs in <lb/>culture. 394 FGFR4 plays a role in cell fate determination during <lb/>embryonic muscle development. 429 However, FGFR4-null mice are <lb/>healthy and fertile with no evident muscle defects, which hints <lb/>that FGFR4 is dispensable during embryonic development. 306 <lb/>FGF signaling in the heart <lb/>Unlike other tissues and organs such as muscle, blood, and liver, <lb/>the mammalian heart possesses very limited regenerative <lb/>capacity. Mammalian cardiomyocytes could robustly proliferate <lb/>in the second heart field during early organogenesis. 430 However, <lb/>recent lineage tracing studies dubbed c-Kit-positive cardiac stem <lb/>cells (CSCs), which had no cardiogenic activity and could not <lb/>support heart repair in adulthood. 431-434 Instead, the injured <lb/>myocardium develops scar and fibrosis. 435 Thus, researchers have <lb/>been tempted to uncover the mechanisms of the cardiogenesis <lb/>and regeneration, which may make it possible to stimulate and <lb/>manipulate the regenerative potential of heart. FGF signaling <lb/>pathways, especially FGFs, have been shown to be highly involved <lb/>in the cardiac development, diseases, and repair. <lb/>FGF1. FGF1 together with TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis <lb/>(TWEAK), by binding to FGFR1, could induce cardiomyocyte cycle <lb/>re-entry. 436 This effect can be blocked by inhibiting the TNF <lb/>receptor superfamily member FGF-inducible molecule 14. TWEAK <lb/>induces the activation of cardiomyocyte cycle, which can be <lb/>inhibited by blocking FGFR1 signaling. 436 Co-stimulation experi-<lb/>ments showed that FGF1 and TWEAK could regulate the <lb/>cardiomyocyte cycle induction via PI3K/AKT signaling. 436 It is also <lb/>reported that the treatment of FGF1 stimulation and p38 <lb/>inhibition have protective effect on ischemic heart disease by <lb/>inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. 437,438 In vitro postnatal <lb/>mammalian cardiomyocytes can proliferate under the <lb/>FGF1 stimulation and p38 MAPK (p38) inhibition, 439 and the <lb/>combination treatment also increases cardiomyocyte mitosis after <lb/>acute myocardial injury in 8-10-week-old rats. Four weeks after <lb/>injury, the treatment reduces heart scarring, wall thinning, and <lb/>markedly rescues cardiac function. 439 However, cardiac-specific <lb/>overexpression of FGF1 only delays the formation of myocardial <lb/>infarct, but has no significant effect on maximal infarct size. 440 In <lb/>contrast, inhibition of p38 fails to rescue heart function despite <lb/>increased cardiomyocyte mitosis. These results imply that FGF1 <lb/>might promote the survival of newly generated cardiomyocytes <lb/>through the enhancement of angiogenesis. 439 Even so, the <lb/>combination of FGF1 stimulation and p38 inhibition may have <lb/>therapeutic effect by improving human cardiac regeneration. 435 <lb/>FGF2. FGF2 is widely expressed in murine heart. In FGF2 <lb/>transgenic mice, the hearts exhibit exacerbated cardiac hyper-<lb/>trophy assessed by myocyte cross-sectional area and heart <lb/>weight-to-body weight ratios, which is eliminated in the presence <lb/>of ERK inhibitor, but not p38 pathway inhibitor. 441 In contrast, the <lb/>chronic elevation of blood pressure, fibrosis, and hypertrophy <lb/>induced by two-kidney one-clip can be attenuated in FGF2 <lb/></body>

			<body>knockout mice. 442 Isoproterenol-induced and myocardial infarct-<lb/>induced cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy can also be attenuated <lb/>in FGF2 knockout mice. 441,443 Besides, FGF2 is a cardio-protector in <lb/>myocardial infarction models and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) <lb/>injury. 444 The expression of FGF2 is shown to be upregulated <lb/>after a cardiac injury. 445 FGF2 inhibits the autophagy and <lb/>increased the clearance of ubiquitinated protein through PI3K/ <lb/>AKT/mTOR signaling in mouse myocardial I/R injury model. 446 <lb/>FGF2 also suppresses endoplasmic stress and mitochondrial <lb/>dysfunction through PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK signaling path-<lb/>ways. 446 Therefore, FGF2 is being tried for treating ischemic <lb/>conditions in several clinically relevant trials. 447-449 <lb/>FGF9. FGF9, expressed in the endocardium and epicardium, <lb/>regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation during embryogenesis, 450 <lb/>and newborn FGF9 knockout mice develop a dilated cardiomyo-<lb/>pathy due to premature differentiation of cardiomyocytes. 450 FGF9 <lb/>is also shown to improve systolic function and heart failure <lb/>mortality by stimulating the hypertrophy of non-infarcted left <lb/>ventricular after myocardial infarction with increased microvessel <lb/>density (MVD), reduced fetal gene expression, and interstitial <lb/>fibrosis in myocardium-specific transgenic FGF9 mice. 451 However, <lb/>FGF9 only stimulates the network formation and the proliferation <lb/>of endothelial cells (ECs) without induction effects on myocardial <lb/>hypertrophy in culture. 451 It is reported that FGF9 can mediate the <lb/>differentiation of monocytes to M2 macrophages; FGF9 treatment <lb/>of an infarcted myocardium in diabetic mice increased anti-<lb/>inflammatory cytokines and M2 macrophage differentiation, <lb/>which resulted in reduced adverse remodeling and improved <lb/>cardiac function. 452 Therefore, FGF9 may have novel therapeutic <lb/>potential for this type of myocardial infarction. <lb/>FGF10. FGF10 is found in the second heart field during early <lb/>heart development, 430 and also expressed in progenitors for the <lb/>right ventricle and outflow tract. 453 Neonatal mouse hearts <lb/>possess the regenerative ability, but gradually lose this ability <lb/>after postnatal day 7. 454 FGF10 is reported to promote regional <lb/>fetal cardiomyocyte proliferation and cell-cycle re-entry of adult <lb/>cardiomyocytes, but has no effect on fibroblasts that is mediated <lb/>by FOXO3/P27. 454 In addition, FGF10 deficiency mice display <lb/>misplacement of the heart in the thoracic cavity with right <lb/>ventricular hypoplasia due to reduced cardiomyocyte prolifera-<lb/>tion. 455 In contrast, overexpression of FGF10 in the myocardium of <lb/>mice promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation after heart injury <lb/>without the increase of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and <lb/>fibrosis; 456 thus, FGF10 may be a potential drug for cardiac repair. <lb/>FGF SIGNALING IN ANGIOGENESIS, LYMPHANGIOGENESIS, <lb/>AND RELATED DISEASES <lb/>Angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis is the process of vascular or <lb/>lymphatic formation during physiological and pathological con-<lb/>ditions, such as embryogenesis, trauma, inflammation, and tumor <lb/>development. Since lymphatics can be derived from the sprouting <lb/>of veins, lymphangiogenesis is considered to be associated with <lb/>angiogenesis. 457 FGF/FGFR signaling has been demonstrated to <lb/>play important roles in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. <lb/>Expressions of FGFs/FGFRs during angiogenesis and <lb/>lymphangiogenesis <lb/>FGFR1 is expressed in vascular ECs and FGFR1 knockdown leads to <lb/>upregulated FGFR3 expression in the endothelium. 458 FGFR2 was <lb/>found expressed in murine aortic endothelium. 459 ECs express the <lb/>FGFR1IIIc, FGFR2IIIc, and FGFR3IIIc isoforms of FGFRs, but not the <lb/>IIIb isoforms nor FGFR4, and vascular SMCs (VSMCs) express <lb/>the similar isoforms of FGFRs; several FGFs are expressed in ECs <lb/>(FGFs 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 16, and 18) and VSMCs (FGF1, 2, 5, 8, 16, and 18). <lb/>FGFR1 and FGFR3 are expressed in lymphatic ECs (LECs) during <lb/>lymphangiogenesis as demonstrated by several studies, 458,460 and <lb/>they were reported to be critical for the lymphatic formation. <lb/>FGF signaling in vascular and lymphatic formation <lb/>FGF signaling can influence the whole process of angiogenesis. <lb/>Activation of FGFR1 or FGFR2 has been demonstrated to have a <lb/>positive effect on vascular endothelial proliferation. 461 One <lb/>important step of angiogenesis is extracellular matrix degradation. <lb/>Some FGFs, including FGF1, FGF2, and FGF4, promote the <lb/>expressions of MMPs in ECs. 462 FGF2 can stimulate shedding of <lb/>MMP2 and MMP9 in cell surface membrane vesicles from ECs, <lb/>which is able to stimulate the angiogenesis of ECs seeded in <lb/>Matrigel. 463 Another essential step of angiogenesis is endothelium <lb/>migration. FGF1, FGF2, FGF8, and FGF10 were demonstrated to <lb/>stimulate endothelium chemotaxis. 464 The pro-chemotactic effect <lb/>of FGF2 depends on activation of MAPK. 465 <lb/>The role of FGFR3 in lymphangiogenesis is controversial. It is <lb/>revealed that FGFR3 is a novel target gene of PROX1, which is <lb/>essential for lymphatic development. Knockdown FGFR3 by small <lb/>interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited LEC proliferation. 460 Meanwhile, <lb/>9-cis retinoic acid (9-cisRA) was reported to activate FGF signaling <lb/>and enhance lymphatic formation and regeneration by promoting <lb/>the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of LECs. 466 FGFR3 <lb/>expression in LECs was upregulated after 9-cisRA treatment. 9-<lb/>cisRA-induced LEC proliferation and migration were significantly <lb/>inhibited by soluble FGFR3 recombinant protein as well as FGFR <lb/>inhibitor PD173074. 466 However, Yu et al. 458 showed that FGFR3 <lb/>alone is not enough to influence lymphangiogenesis. Vascular and <lb/>lymphatic vessel defects were observed in FGFR1/FGFR3 double <lb/>mutant mice, but single knockout of FGFR1 or FGFR3 led to no <lb/>abnormality in lymphatic front migration in embryonic mouse skin <lb/>examined by whole-mount staining for VEGFR3 (vascular endothe-<lb/>lial growth factor receptor 3) and PECAM1 (platelet and <lb/>endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1). The controversial effects <lb/>of FGFR3 on lymphatics may be due to its differential influence on <lb/>LECs during embryonic phase or adulthood. <lb/>FGF/FGFR-related diseases with abnormal angiogenesis and <lb/>lymphangiogenesis <lb/>There are few clinical reports about the relationships between <lb/>FGFs/FGFRs and diseases with abnormal angiogenesis and <lb/>lymphangiogenesis. Some experimental results demonstrate that <lb/>FGFs/FGFRs may play an essential role in diseases with abnormal <lb/>vascular formation. Many tumor cell lines produce FGF2. 467 <lb/>Inhibition of FGFR1 by FGF2 antisense complementary DNAs <lb/>(cDNAs) suppressed vascularization and growth of human <lb/>melanomas in nude mice. 468 Furthermore, FGF levels were <lb/>correlated with intratumoral MVD, an important parameter for <lb/>tumor progression. 469 In some tumors like melanoma, FGF2 level <lb/>has a strong correlation with MVD and clinical outcome of the <lb/>patients. 469 However, whether FGFs/FGFRs also influence tumor <lb/>parenchyma needs to be further clarified. Inflammation is an <lb/>important trigger for angiogenesis. It is revealed that monocytes, <lb/>mononuclear phagocytes, and mast cells express FGF2. 470 <lb/>Inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β can stimulate FGF2 <lb/>production in ECs. 471 Inflammatory mediators might stimulate <lb/>angiogenesis through increasing FGF signaling in endothelium. EC <lb/>death can lead to increased FGF2 release. Hypoxia upregulates <lb/>VEGF and FGF2 production and increases endothelial responsive-<lb/>ness to FGF2. 472 The activity of FGF/FGFR signaling may be <lb/>strongly associated with inflammation and influence angiogenesis <lb/>at multiple levels. <lb/>FGF signaling and EndMT <lb/>Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is the process <lb/>through which ECs transform into mesenchymal cells. EndMT <lb/>plays important roles in the pathogenesis of various human <lb/>diseases, including cardiac fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and <lb/></body>

			<body>heterotopic ossification (HO). 473 EndMT was first confirmed in <lb/>animal models in which Tie1 + endothelials adopted cardiac <lb/>fibroblast fate during cardiac fibrosis development. 474 Further <lb/>investigations found that Tie2 + vascular ECs contributed to HO <lb/>formation in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive and BMP4-<lb/>induced HO mouse models. 475 Currently, TGF-β1 signaling is <lb/>regarded as the main inducer of EndMT. 473 FGF signaling has <lb/>recently been demonstrated to downregulate TGF-β signaling and <lb/>inhibit EndMT. Basal FGF signaling maintains endothelial home-<lb/>ostasis through inhibiting the expressions of TGF-β, TGF-βR1, and <lb/>SMAD2 via controlling the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) levels. 476 <lb/>Meanwhile, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that <lb/>inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β, <lb/>decreased FGFR1 expression, leading to reduced FGF signaling <lb/>activation in ECs. 476 Another study reported that FGF2 can induce <lb/>miRNA-20a expression, which represses TGF-β signaling in <lb/>endothelium and inhibits EndMT. 477 Therefore, it is plausible that <lb/>FGF signaling downregulation by inflammatory cytokines con-<lb/>tributes to vascular neointima formation and fibrosis driven by <lb/>TGF-β-induced EndMT. <lb/>Therapeutic modulation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis <lb/>Therapeutic angiogenesis is a promising approach to the recovery <lb/>of ischemic diseases. It was shown that intracoronary FGF2 <lb/>administration preserved myocardial function by increasing <lb/>vascularization. 478 Some clinical trials demonstrated that FGF2 <lb/>administration can improve the symptoms of patients with <lb/>coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. 448,479 In <lb/>addition, inhibition of FGF2/FGFR1 by antisense cDNAs blocked <lb/>intratumoral angiogenesis and arrested the growth of human <lb/>melanomas grown subcutaneously in nude mice. 468 <lb/>FGF-based angiogenic therapy has been shown to be a <lb/>potential treatment for patients with ischemic diseases. However, <lb/>many details including timing, dosage, application alone, or in <lb/>combinations with other drugs and effective delivery approach <lb/>need to be further clarified. There are few reports about the <lb/>therapeutic modulation of lymphangiogenesis based on FGF <lb/>signaling. 9-cisRA was reported to have a therapeutic effect on <lb/>lymphatic regeneration and secondary lymphedema in experi-<lb/>mental mouse models, which could be dependent on FGF <lb/>signaling in LECs. 466 <lb/>FGF SIGNALING IN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE <lb/>Inflammation is a complex adaptive response that can be induced <lb/>by endogenous and exogenous substances/stimuli. 480 Besides the <lb/>recognition of inducers, inflammatory response includes multiple <lb/>process such as the production of multiple inflammatory <lb/>mediators, including inflammatory factors, chemokines, and <lb/>vasoactive amines, which are released by immune cells like <lb/>macrophages and mast cells. 480 There are lots of studies reported <lb/>that FGFs/FGFRs play important roles in the regulation of <lb/>inflammationory response. <lb/>FGFs in inflammation <lb/>FGF1 in inflammation. FGF1 can accentuate inflammatory <lb/>response. 481 Generally, FGF1 is highly expressed in the inflamma-<lb/>tory cells and tissues. High levels of FGF1 can be found in multiple <lb/>tissues of inflammatory arthritic joints, including bone, cartilage, <lb/>synovium, ligament, and tendon. 482 Besides, most T cells in <lb/>synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis express FGFR1 for FGF1. 483 <lb/>FGF1 can enhance IL-2 production and activation of NF-κB in <lb/>T cells. 483 Rossini et al. 484 found that both FGF1 and FGFR1 are <lb/>expressed in filtrating lymphocytes and macrophages during the <lb/>renal inflammation, and FGFR1 is highly expressed in tubules, <lb/>suggesting that FGF1 might have both autocrine and paracrine <lb/>functions. Hackshaw and Shi 485 reported that FGF1 affects the <lb/>calcium mobilization and increases the level of cytosolic calcium in <lb/>macrophages. FGF1 causes ATP release from spinal astrocytes and <lb/>opens gap junction channels after spinal cord injury, which may <lb/>aggravate the inflammation in neurological disease and <lb/>injury. 486,487 Recently, Huang et al. 488 engineered the FGF1 <lb/>mutants (termed FGF1 ΔHBS ) with reduced ability to activate FGFR, <lb/>and found that FGF1 ΔHBS inhibited inflammation and oxidative <lb/>stress in CKD via activating PI3K/AKT and GSK-3β/Nrf2 signaling <lb/>pathways, which inhibited the ASK1/JNK. 489 The results suggest <lb/>that FGF1 bears the responsibility of anti-inflammation, especially <lb/>in certain chronic inflammatory diseases. Besides, FGF1 has the <lb/>ability of anti-inflammation in diabetic nephropathy via inhibition <lb/>of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and NF-κB pathways. 490 Thus, the <lb/>effects of FGF1 on inflammation may vary from different diseases <lb/>and conditions. <lb/>FGF2 in inflammation. FGF2 is also involved in several <lb/>inflammation-related diseases such as multiple sclerosis and <lb/>rheumatoid arthritis. 491 Ectopic expression of FGF2 exacerbates <lb/>inflammatory response and symptom of colitis and collagen-<lb/>induced arthritis models. 492,493 FGF2 contributes to the inflamma-<lb/>tion in articular cartilage during the process of OA. 494 Besides, the <lb/>level of FGF2 is increased during the whole blood inflammatory <lb/>reaction induced by the artificial surface. 495 During the infection of <lb/>HIV, FGF2 shows a positive correlation with the number of CD4 + T <lb/>cell. 496 FGF2 induces the expression of RANKL via ERK1/2 <lb/>activation in human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, <lb/>which suggests that FGF2 may play the osteoimmunological role <lb/>during bone regeneration. 497 Pawlowski et al. 498 found that FGF2 <lb/>is highly expressed in fibroblasts and adipocytes, and FGF2 may <lb/>contribute to perpetuation of inflammation in the orbital tissue of <lb/>Graves&apos; orbitopathy. FGF2 has close relationship with inflamma-<lb/>tory response during angiogenesis such as activation of pro-<lb/>inflammatory chemokines in ECs and engagement of monocyte/ <lb/>macrophage. 499 FGF2 increases the concentrations of cellular IL-1β <lb/>in human VSMCs. 500 The above studies indicate that FGF2 has the <lb/>function of pro-inflammation. However, exogenic FGF2 could <lb/>attenuate inflammatory response such as the decreased expres-<lb/>sion of IL-1β in epileptogenesis-associated neuroinflammation. 501 <lb/>In addition, inhaling recombinant FGF2 decreases lung inflamma-<lb/>tion in asthma and COPD. 502,503 Thus, targeting FGF2 is a potential <lb/>method to alleviate certain inflammatory diseases such as <lb/>neuroinflammation, asthma, and COPD. <lb/>FGF3/FGF21/FGF23 in inflammation. Unlike FGF1 and FGF2, there <lb/>are few studies that reported the relationship between FGF3 and <lb/>inflammation. The level of FGF3 in sinonasal tissues is significantly <lb/>upregulated in acute allergic rhinitis and chronic sinonasal <lb/>inflammation mouse models. 504,505 However, FGF3 level in middle <lb/>ears is significantly downregulated in mouse model for acute otitis <lb/>media. 506 Combining these results, we speculate that the role of <lb/>FGF3 in inflammation may be distinct in the different tissues/ <lb/>organs. <lb/>FGF21 can be induced by inflammatory stimuli. 507-509 FGF21 is <lb/>associated with the suppression of cardiac, renal, and hepatic <lb/>inflammation. 510-512 FGF21 is thought to be one of the potential <lb/>immunotherapy targets for cardiovascular inflammation and <lb/>pancreatic fibrogenesis as it can alter the macrophage polarization <lb/>states. 513,514 Exogenous FGF21 was found to alleviate soakage of <lb/>inflammatory cells in the lung potentially via elevation of IL-10. 515 <lb/>FGF21 inhibits macrophage migration and significantly reduces <lb/>inflammatory factor expression in oxidized low-density lipopro-<lb/>tein-induced THP-1 macrophages. 516 In addition, FGF21 can also <lb/>repress inflammatory factors induced by insulin resistance. 517 <lb/>FGF21 has anti-inflammatory effect on preadipocytes via FRS2/ <lb/>ERK1/2 signaling pathway. 518 Besides, FGF21 can suppress the <lb/>production of IL-1β mediated by NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-and pyrin <lb/>domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome. 519 In general, <lb/>inflammation increases the expression of FGF21, which is an <lb/></body>

			<body>anti-inflammatory factor in many diseases. <lb/>The relationship between inflammation and FGF23 may be <lb/>bidirectional. 520 Lang et al. 521 suggested that the increase of <lb/>FGF23 induced by inflammatory signaling may amplify inflamma-<lb/>tion by suppressing the synthesis of the anti-inflammatory 1,25 <lb/>(OH) 2 D 3 in inflammatory diseases. Besides, FGF23 can induce <lb/>multiple inflammatory signaling pathways like TNF-α signaling. In <lb/>addition, FGF23 activates calcineurin signaling by activating FGFR4 <lb/>in hepatocytes, which causes the increased level of inflammatory <lb/>cytokines in CKD. 522 In summary, inflammatory response can <lb/>induce the expression of FGF23 and FGF23 can act as a pro-<lb/>inflammatory factor. <lb/>FGFRs in inflammation <lb/>In addition to the FGFs, the receptors of FGFs also play important <lb/>roles in inflammatory response. FGFR1 promotes inflammation via <lb/>activating NF-κB signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells. 523 <lb/>However, FGF2/FGFR1 pathway has inhibitive effects on astrocyte-<lb/>mediated neuroinflammation after infrasound exposure. 524 In <lb/>turn, there is a profound reduction in FGFR1 in human umbilical <lb/>vein ECs treated by TNF-α and IL-1β, while other inflammatory <lb/>cytokines such as IL-6 could not inhibit the expression of FGFR1. 476 <lb/>Besides, our group recently identified that FGFR3 deficiency <lb/>promoted chemotaxis of macrophages via activation of NF-κB/ <lb/>CXCR7 signaling pathway, which reveals the negative role of <lb/>FGFR3 in synovial inflammatory response. 228 More studies about <lb/>the roles of FGFRs in inflammation are needed in the future. <lb/>Inflammatory response is regulated by multiple factors in a <lb/>variety of cellular behaviors. 525 Targeting pro-inflammatory factors <lb/>such as IL-6 and TNF-α has been shown to be an effective therapy <lb/>for some inflammatory diseases, and therapeutic antibodies are <lb/>also promising strategy to treat inflammatory diseases. 526,527 From <lb/>the above studies, we can conclude that FGF signaling has close <lb/>relationships with inflammatory response, and whether it exerts a <lb/>pro-inflammatory or an anti-inflammatory role mainly depends on <lb/>the types of FGFs and inflammation of diseases. Application of <lb/>specific modulatory molecules such as antibodies against pro-<lb/>inflammatory FGFs/FGFRs like FGF23 will benefit for certain <lb/>inflammation-related diseases. <lb/>FGF SIGNALING IN METABOLISM <lb/>Among the 22 members of the FGF family, FGF15/19, FGF21, and <lb/>FGF23 comprise the FGF19 subfamily that functions as endocrine <lb/>hormones to regulate bile acid (BA), fatty acid, glucose, and <lb/>mineral metabolism. <lb/>FGF15/FGF19 in energy homeostasis <lb/>FGF15 and its human ortholog FGF19 (FGF15/19) are gut-derived <lb/>circulating hormone that represses hepatic BA synthesis through <lb/>FGFR4 and the coreceptor KLB complex. 528 Furthermore, FGF15/19 <lb/>also regulates global body energy and glucose homeostasis <lb/>(Fig. 3). 529-531 <lb/>FGF15 is highly expressed in the ileum, jejunum, and <lb/>duodenum of adult mice. 532,533 FGF19 is expressed in human <lb/>ileum and gallbladder epithelial cells, 534,535 and is not detected <lb/>normally in human liver. 536 The expression and production of <lb/>FGF15/19 are regulated by many factors, such as BAs, nutrition, <lb/>and so on. 537,538 <lb/>Effect on liver and gallbladder <lb/>BA homeostasis: FGF15/19 negatively regulates BA synthesis. <lb/>FGF19 treatment inhibits the expression of cholesterol 7α-<lb/>hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting and major regulatory <lb/>enzyme of BAs, by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism in <lb/>hepatocytes. 529,539 Deletion of FGF15 in mice results in enhanced <lb/>BA production by upregulating CYP7A1 expression in the liver, <lb/>while FGF15 administration inhibits BA production by decreasing <lb/>CYP7A1 mRNA levels. 533 <lb/>The alternation of gallbladder filling and emptying regulates the <lb/>bile flowing into the intestine. FGF15/FGF19 is required for <lb/>gallbladder filling as evidenced by the absence of bile in the <lb/>gallbladder of FGF15 knockout mice, and FGF15 or FGF19 <lb/>treatment leads to significant increase in gallbladder volume, <lb/>which is partially caused by a cAMP-dependent relaxation of <lb/>gallbladder smooth muscle. 540 <lb/>Hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism: Fed FGF15 knockout mice <lb/>showed decreased hepatic glycogen stores in the liver, and <lb/>administration of FGF19 significantly promotes glycogen <lb/>Fig. 3 The regulation of FGF15/19 on energy metabolism. FGF15/19 regulates energy metabolism both peripherally and centrally. In the liver, <lb/>FGF15/19 inhibits BA production and promotes gallbladder filling. As for lipid and glucose metabolism, FGF15/19 improves glycogen <lb/>synthesis, but suppresses lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. In the adipose tissue, FGF15/19 promotes energy expenditure and fatty acid <lb/>oxidation. In the brain, FGF15/19 promotes the expression of CRF in the hypothalamus and stimulates sympathetic nerve activity, and then <lb/>increases energy expenditure in the adipose tissue. Furthermore, FGF15/19 promotes peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism by <lb/>repressing HPA axis and AGRP/NPY neuron activity.

			<body>accumulation and protein synthesis in the liver of fasted mice, <lb/>which is independent of insulin action. 541 FGF15/19 also <lb/>suppresses hepatic metabolic, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle <lb/>flux and gluconeogenesis, through inhibiting CREB-PGC-1α (cyclic <lb/>AMP response element binding protein-peroxisome proliferator-<lb/>activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α) signaling. 542 <lb/>FGF15/19 represses liver fat storage. FGF19 transgenic mice <lb/>show decreased expression of lipogenic enzymes and liver <lb/>triglyceride levels. 530 FGF19 inhibits the expression of lipogenic <lb/>enzymes and the insulin lipogenic action in rat primary <lb/>hepatocytes through activating STAT3 signaling and repressing <lb/>PGC-1β expression, 543 and also enhances the expression of fatty <lb/>acid oxidation-related proteins. 544 Long-term treatment by FGF19 <lb/>reduces liver lipid accumulation in vivo and protects liver from <lb/>diet-induced steatosis. 545 <lb/>Effect on body energy and glucose homeostasis. FGF15/19 is <lb/>beneficial for global energy balance. FGF19 transgenic mice have <lb/>a significantly reduced fat mass resulted from increased metabolic <lb/>rate that leads to enhanced energy expenditure, and do not <lb/>become diabetic or obese when fed a high-fat diet (HFD). 530 In <lb/>HFD fed mice, FGF19 increases the metabolic rate simultaneously <lb/>with an increased fatty acid oxidation, and alleviates the obesity in <lb/>ob/ob mice. 529 Adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of FGF15 <lb/>and FGF19 reduces fat mass and increases energy expenditure in <lb/>diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice, and FGF19 can also overt <lb/>diabetes in db/db mice. 531 <lb/>In addition to the direct effects of FGF15/19 on body energy <lb/>metabolism, FGF15/19 also regulates the energy and glucose <lb/>metabolism by affecting brain after binding to FGFR4 and KLB in <lb/>the brain. 358,546 FGF19 activates ERK signaling in the hypothala-<lb/>mus. 547 Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of FGF19 induces <lb/>the sympathetic nerve activity to BAT and increases energy <lb/>expenditure, 548 and also improves peripheral insulin sensitivity <lb/>and glucose metabolism by reducing hypothalamic agouti-related <lb/>protein/neuropeptide Y neuron activity and activating of ERK1/ <lb/>2 signaling in obese and insulin-resistant states. 547 Furthermore, <lb/>FGF15/19 signaling in the central nervous system has an insulin-<lb/>independent glucose-lowering effect. Acute ICV FGF19 injection <lb/>reduces food intake and body weight, and improves glucose <lb/>tolerance without changing plasma insulin levels. 546,549 The <lb/>suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and subse-<lb/>quent decreased hepatic acetyl CoA level are responsible for <lb/>mediating the insulin-independent, glucose-lowering effects of <lb/>FGF19. 549 <lb/>Metabolic role of FGF21 <lb/>FGF21 is mainly expressed in the liver, adipose tissue and <lb/>pancreas, 550,551 and also expressed in the muscle. 552 Under <lb/>physiologic conditions, FGF21 in the blood is mostly derived from <lb/>the liver. 551 FGF21 activates FGF signaling by binding to FGFR1c <lb/>and its coreceptor protein KLB in the liver, adipose tissue, and <lb/>brain. 532 <lb/>FGF21 is a hormone regulating glucose and lipid homeostasis, <lb/>and insulin sensitivity. FGF21 can cause weight loss, decrease <lb/>plasma glucose and triglycerides level, and improve insulin <lb/>sensitivity in obese and diabetic animal models without affecting <lb/>total caloric intake. 553,554 Mice with overexpressed FGF21 resist to <lb/>DIO. In both ob/ob and db/db mice, 553,554 treatment of FGF21 <lb/>decreased serum glucose and triglycerides to near normal levels. <lb/>FGF21 regulates glucose and lipid metabolism mainly by affecting <lb/>liver, adipose tissue, and brain (Fig. 4). <lb/>The effect on liver. Nutritional stresses, such as starvation, amino <lb/>acid restriction, ketogenic, and HFD, can strongly induce the <lb/>expression and release of FGF21 in liver. 555 <lb/>FGF21 decreases insulin resistance, enhances fat oxidation, and <lb/>suppresses hepatic steatosis in the liver of DIO and ob/ob <lb/>mice, 553,554 which is related to the increased level of adiponectin <lb/>in vivo. 556 FGF21 participates in high-fat, low-carbohydrate <lb/>ketogenic diet-induced triglyceride clearance, hepatic lipid oxida-<lb/>tion, and ketogenesis. Downregulated hepatic FGF21 in ketogenic <lb/>diet-fed mice altered the expressions of lipid and ketone <lb/>metabolism-related genes in the liver, and leads to fatty liver, <lb/>lipemia, and decreased serum ketone. 557 FGF21 stimulates hepatic <lb/>gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in the liver during fasting and <lb/>starvation 558,559 by inducing the expression of PGC-1α. 559 FGF21 <lb/>knockout mice fail to induce PGC-1α expression and have <lb/>impaired gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in response to a <lb/>prolonged fast. 559 However, the mechanisms for the regulation of <lb/>FGF21 on liver metabolism need to be further explored. <lb/>The effect on adipose tissue. In addition to liver, adipose tissue is <lb/>another source of systemic FGF21. White adipose tissue (WAT) <lb/>stores energy, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) expends energy to <lb/>generate heat through a process known as adaptive thermogen-<lb/>esis. 560 FGF21 in WAT is induced by fasting/refeeding regimens <lb/>and the thiazolidinedione drugs. 558 FGF21 in BAT is induced by <lb/>cold exposure. 561 <lb/>FGF21 stimulates glucose uptake in adipocytes in an insulin-<lb/>independent manner through induction of GLUT1 expression, 562 <lb/>and inhibits lipolysis of adipocytes. 563 However, FGF21 stimulates <lb/>lipolysis in WAT during starvation. 558 <lb/>The thermogenic activity of BAT and browning of WAT are <lb/>important components of energy expenditure, which can be <lb/>induced by FGF21. 554,564 Cold exposure induces expression of <lb/>mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in BAT. UCP1 <lb/>uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, releasing chemical energy <lb/>as heat. 565 FGF21 improves the expression of UCP1 in WAT by <lb/>upregulating PGC-1α protein level and promoting browning of <lb/>WAT in adaptive thermogenesis. 559,566 FGF21 knockout mice show <lb/>diminished browning of WAT and a decreased adaption to chronic <lb/>cold exposure. 566 In addition, FGF21 also upregulates UCP1 mRNA <lb/>expression through CREB 567 signaling, and induces phosphoryla-<lb/>tion of STAT3 to activate the oxidative metabolism in adipose <lb/>tissues. 567 <lb/>FGF21 also promotes adipocyte differentiation and insulin <lb/>sensitivity by stimulating peroxisome proliferator-activated recep-<lb/>tor-γ (PPAR-γ) transcriptional activity through inhibiting its <lb/>SUMOylation in WAT 568,569 in DIO mice. FGF21 knockout mice <lb/>show decreased WAT mass with reduced PPAR-γ activity, <lb/>adipocyte size, and insulin sensitivity in DIO mice. 569 <lb/>The effect on brain. In addition to regulating liver and adipose <lb/>tissue, FGF21 also involves in energy metabolism through <lb/>regulating brain. FGF21 is not expressed in the central nervous <lb/>system, 532 but can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter into the <lb/>brain. 570 ICV injection of FGF21 in obese rats increases hepatic <lb/>insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure. 571 FGF21 improves the <lb/>expression of neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor in the <lb/>hypothalamus and stimulates sympathetic nerve activity, and then <lb/>promotes energy expenditure in BAT. 572 Furthermore, FGF21 <lb/>activates the HPA axis for the release of corticosterone that <lb/>stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis. 359 <lb/>The effect of FGF23 on mineral metabolism <lb/>FGF23 is mainly secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes in bone <lb/>tissue, 573 and regulates systemic phosphate homeostasis and <lb/>vitamin D metabolism through binding FGFR and the coreceptor <lb/>α-Klotho complex in cell membranes of target tissues 574 (Fig. 5). <lb/>The effect on metabolism of phosphate, sodium, and calcium. <lb/>Clinical studies identified the important role of FGF23 in regulating <lb/>phosphate metabolism.

			<body>the cause of tumor-induced osteomalacia and fibrous dysplasia <lb/>because of its overexpression in tumors and osteogenic cells in <lb/>fibrous dysplastic lesions. 575 Furthermore, multiple FGF23 gene <lb/>mutations lead to reduced FGF23 level in patients, which is <lb/>responsible for hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis, a <lb/>genetic disease characterized by hyperphosphatemia and tumor-<lb/>like soft tissue calcifications. 576 In mouse models, overexpression <lb/>of FGF23 in the liver, osteoblasts, or ubiquitously in mice lead to <lb/>decreased serum phosphate concentration and rachitic <lb/>bone. 177,577,578 <lb/>Phosphate homeostasis is simultaneously regulated by several <lb/>organs, including the kidney, intestine, and bone. 579 Type II <lb/>sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporters (NPT2) are respon-<lb/>sible for the absorption of extracellular phosphate. 580 Type IIa <lb/>sodium-phosphate co-transporter (NPT2a, NaPi-2a) is mainly <lb/>expressed in the brush-border membrane of proximal tubules of <lb/>the kidney. 581 FGF23 inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption and <lb/>leads to phosphate loss by inhibiting the expression of NaPi-2a/2c <lb/>through binding to a FGFR1-α-Klotho coreceptor complex and <lb/>activating ERK signaling. 582 NaPi-2b is expressed in the luminal <lb/>membrane of the ileum and regulates phosphate absorption in <lb/>the intestine. 583 FGF23 can reduce NaPi-2b level to inhibit <lb/>phosphate absorption in the intestine. 584 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 also <lb/>promotes phosphate absorption in the intestine. 585 FGF23 can <lb/>reduce 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 level by inhibiting 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1a-<lb/>hydroxylase and increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase <lb/>expression in the kidney, 586 and then may indirectly suppress 1,25 <lb/>(OH) 2 D 3 -mediated intestinal phosphate absorption. <lb/>In addition, FGF23 also regulates the metabolism of sodium and <lb/>calcium. FGF23 promotes sodium reabsorption by increasing the <lb/>sodium chloride co-transporter expression in the distal renal <lb/>tubules resulting in volume expansion and hypertension. 587 FGF23 <lb/>directly promotes calcium reabsorption in the kidney by regulat-<lb/>ing transient receptor potential vanilloid-5 channels in the distal <lb/>renal tubules. 588 Furthermore, 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 promotes calcium <lb/>absorption in the small intestine. 589 PTH promotes calcium <lb/>absorption in the kidney via increasing the 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 level <lb/>and accelerates calcium release from the bone by stimulating <lb/>bone resorption. FGF23 can systematically regulate serum calcium <lb/>by decreasing serum levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and PTH. <lb/>The regulation of FGF23. FGF signaling participates in the <lb/>regulation of FGF23. Several OGD patients caused by activating <lb/>mutations of FGFR1 present hypophosphatemia and increased <lb/>serum level of FGF23. 132 Inhibition of FGFR1 decreased FGF23 <lb/>mRNA expression in the bone. 590 Integrative nuclear FGFR1 <lb/>promotes FGF23 transcription by activating the transcription <lb/>factor CREB. 591 HMW isoform of FGF2 (HMWFGF2), the ligand for <lb/>nuclear FGFR1, stimulates FGF23 expression. 592 Transgenic mice <lb/>with overexpression of HMW FGF2 in immature and mature <lb/>Fig. 4 The regulation of FGF21 on energy metabolism. FGF21 regulates energy metabolism in peripheral and central manners. In the liver, <lb/>FGF21 promotes gluconeogenesis and lipid oxidation, and thus improves ketogenesis and insulin sensitivity. In the adipose tissue, <lb/>FGF21 simulates glucose uptake in both WAT and BAT and induces WAT browning, as well as promotes energy expenditure, while FGF21 <lb/>inhibits lipolysis. In the brain, FGF21 stimulates the HPA axis, thus contributing to corticosterone release and ultimately promoting <lb/>gluconeogenesis in the liver. Furthermore, FGF21 improves CRF expression in the hypothalamus and stimulates sympathetic nerve activity, <lb/>and then promotes energy expenditure in BAT.

FGF23 down-<lb/>regulates serum phosphate. In the kidney, FGF23 reduces 1,25 <lb/>(OH) 2 D 3 level and inhibits renal phosphate resorption by inhibiting <lb/>the expression of NaPi-2a/2c. In the intestine, FGF23 inhibits <lb/>phosphate absorption by reducing NaPi-2b expression or indirectly <lb/>suppressing 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 .

			<body>osteoblasts display increased FGF23 level, hypophosphatemia, <lb/>and rickets. 592 <lb/>Some proteins regulating phosphate homeostasis are also <lb/>expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, such as DMP1 and <lb/>PHEX, 593,594 and regulate FGF23 expression. Inactivating muta-<lb/>tions in DMP1 and PHEX lead to XLH (X-linked hypophosphatemic <lb/>rickets) and ARHR (autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic <lb/>rickets), respectively, accompanying with increased serum FGF23 <lb/>level. 594,595 Both DMP1 and PHEX knockout mice exhibit hypopho-<lb/>sphatemic rickets and increased FGF23 expression. 594,596 Although <lb/>PHEX is a peptidase expressed in the bone, it can inhibit the <lb/>expression FGF23 without regulating FGF23 degradation. 597 <lb/>Some circulating proteins also regulate FGF23 level. FGF23 is <lb/>regulated by feedback loops, including the phosphate level, 1,25 <lb/>(OH) 2 D 3 , and PTH. Either dietary phosphate or administration of <lb/>1,25(OH) 2 D 3 can increase the serum FGF23 level in humans and <lb/>rodents, 598,599 which depends on both translational and post-<lb/>translational regulation of FGF23. 600 FGF23 inhibits PTH synthesis <lb/>and secretion, 601,602 and then contributes to its own negative <lb/>feedback regulation. Patients with hyperparathyroidism have high <lb/>FGF23 level, 603 and some studies including cell culture experi-<lb/>ments showed that PTH induces FGF23 expression in human and <lb/>rodent cells through activating the orphan nuclear receptor <lb/>Nurr1. 604,605 <lb/>Furthermore, iron can regulate FGF23 expression. Iron defi-<lb/>ciency not only increases FGF23 transcription, 606 but also its <lb/>cleavage. 607 However, the detailed mechanism is still unclear. <lb/>FGF SIGNALING IN TUMORS <lb/>A typical regulation of the FGF/FGFR system occurs in multiple <lb/>human tumors, leading to the deregulated activation of ligand-<lb/>dependent or -independent FGFR signaling. <lb/>The expressions and mutations of FGF signaling molecules in <lb/>tumors <lb/>FGF signal is highly related to the initiation and progression of <lb/>several tumors including urothelial carcinoma, multiple myeloma, <lb/>prostate cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Table 2). <lb/>Expressions of FGFs. FGF5 is overexpressed in breast cancer <lb/>tissue. 608 Guo et al. 609 reported that FGF6 was significantly <lb/>decreased in non-metastatic liver cancer lesion tissues and <lb/>increased in metastatic liver carcinoma tissue. FGF7 is expressed <lb/>in normal mucosal gland epithelium and in stromal fibroblasts, <lb/>and FGF7 protein levels were elevated in gastric inflammation and <lb/>gastric adenocarcinoma. 610 Overexpression of FGF8 in prostate <lb/>cancer is highly related to the decreased patient survival and <lb/>persists in androgen-independent disease. 611 FGF8, as cell growth <lb/>regulator, can mediate the tumor suppression effect of Annexin-<lb/>A7 in prostate tumorigenesis. 612 FGF9 is expressed in many non-<lb/>small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) primary tumors and derived cell <lb/>lines. The NSCLC patients with high FGF9 expression had shorter <lb/>overall survival. 613 Aberrant signaling of FGF10 through FGFR2b, <lb/>and in some instances FGFR1b, contributes to the progression of a <lb/>number of human cancers, including breast cancer, prostate <lb/>cancer, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as well as gastric cancer <lb/>(GC), skin cancers, and lung squamous cell carcinomas. 614 FGF12 <lb/>gene was overexpressed in esophageal squamous cells. 615 FGF13 <lb/>was highly upregulated in aggressively metastatic breast tumors <lb/>and pancreatic endocrine tumors. 616 FGF14 was preferentially <lb/>methylated in colorectal cancer. 616 The expression of FGF16 is <lb/>markedly increased in ovarian tumors. 617 FGF17 is overexpressed <lb/>as a potential mediator of FGF8 function in human prostate <lb/>cancer. 618 In genomically stable and chromosomal instable <lb/>subtypes of GC, FGF18 was overexpressed with relevance to poor <lb/>survival. 619 FGF18/FGFR3IIIc was upregulated and could drive <lb/>growth of tumor cell in CD44 + subpopulation of colon adenoma <lb/>cells. 620 Aberrant signaling through FGF19 and its receptor <lb/>FGFR4 seems to be the oncogenic driver for a subset of human <lb/>hepatocellular carcinoma (HCCs) and is associated with poor <lb/>prognosis. 621 Ectopic expression of FGF20 in NIH 3T3 cells <lb/>rendered the cells transformed in vitro and tumorigenic in nude <lb/>mice. 622 The mRNA level of FGF20 was upregulated in adenomas <lb/>in mice and FGF20 is found to be a critical element in Wnt <lb/>signaling-induced oncogenesis. 623 Huang et al. 624 found that <lb/>overexpression of FGF21 delayed the appearance of <lb/>diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors and proposed that <lb/>FGF21 might delay development of adenomas through activation <lb/>of resident hepatocyte FGFR4 at early time. Liu et al. 625 demon-<lb/>strated that FGF22 expression was tightly associated with the poor <lb/>overall survival. FGF23 is present at an increased level and <lb/>promotes the progression of prostate cancer. 626 <lb/>Mutations of FGFs and FGFRs in tumors. The risk of relapse in the <lb/>subgroup of progesterone-receptor-negative patients of breast <lb/>tumors was five times greater for those with int-2/FGF3 amplifica-<lb/>tion than for those without this alteration. 627 High-throughput <lb/>tissue microarray analysis showed that gene amplifications of FGF3 <lb/>and FGF4 were observed in urinary bladder cancer. 628 Kim and his <lb/>colleagues 629 revealed that three SNPs in the FGF23 gene <lb/>(rs11063118, rs13312789, and rs7955866) were associated with <lb/>an increased risk of prostate cancer. Mutations of FGFRs are <lb/>commonly observed in many tumors, including the breast cancer, <lb/>lung cancer, liver cancer, GC, uterine cancer, and bladder <lb/>cancer. 630 FGFR1 amplification is one of the most common focal <lb/>amplifications in breast cancer. 631 FGFR1 amplification was <lb/>observed in 32% of small cell lung cancer samples. 632 A single <lb/>somatic FGFR1 mutation (c.C754A p.P252T) was also detected in a <lb/>bronchoalveolar cancer. 633 Constitutional and somatic FGFR1 <lb/>alterations were frequently observed in dysembryoplastic neuroe-<lb/>pithelial tumor (DNET) and played a key role in the pathogenesis <lb/>of DNET. 634 FGFR2 amplifications have been observed in nearly <lb/>10% of GCs, playing a critical role in the proliferation and survival <lb/>of GC cell. 635 GC cell lines with FGFR2 amplifications were highly <lb/>sensitive to FGFR inhibitors. 636 Dutt et al. 637 reported that somatic <lb/>mutations of FGFR2 were present in 12% of endometrial <lb/>carcinomas, and inhibition of FGFR2 kinase activity in endometrial <lb/>carcinoma cell line bearing such FGFR2 mutations could inhibit its <lb/>transformation and survival, implicating FGFR2 as a novel <lb/>therapeutic target in endometrial carcinoma. FGFR2 fusions were <lb/>reported to be present in up to 13% of liver cancers such as <lb/>intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. 638,639 FGFR2 amplifications <lb/>occur in triple-negative breast cancer, and are associated with <lb/>high sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors. 640 FGFR2 is shown to be <lb/>associated with a higher risk of sporadic post-menopausal breast <lb/>cancer. 641 Amplifications of FGFR3 have been described rarely in <lb/>cancer, while activation of FGFR3 by mutation was quite <lb/>common. 642 FGFR3 alterations (mutations or translocation) are <lb/>among the most frequent genetic events in bladder carcinoma. <lb/>Single-nucleotide substitution mutations of FGFR3 were present in <lb/>35% of bladder carcinomas. 643 The mutations of FGFR3 could lead <lb/>to an aberrant activation of FGFR3 signaling, conferring an <lb/>oncogenic dependence, while inhibition of FGFR3 signaling <lb/>decreased cell viability in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. 644 <lb/>FGFR3 mutations were also identified in cervical cancers, 645 <lb/>multiple myeloma, 38 prostate cancer, 646 testicular tumors, 647 and <lb/>lung adenocarcinoma. 648 FGFR1-3 gene fusions have been <lb/>observed in breast cancer to occur with multiple gene partners <lb/>(i.e., TACC1-3, BAIAP2L1, AFF3, SLC45A3, and AHCYL1). 640 A very low <lb/>level of amplifications of FGFR3 and FGFR4 were detected in breast <lb/>cancer. 649 Mutations in FGFR4 in human rhabdomyosarcoma <lb/>(RMS) could lead to its activation and contribute to RMS <lb/>progression as an oncogene. 650 The mutation of FGFR4 gene <lb/>transcript in MDA-MB-453 mammary carcinoma cells lead to the <lb/>substitution of glycine by arginine at position 388, which <lb/></body>

			<body>increased cell motility. The FGFR4 Arg388 allele was related to the <lb/>metastasis of colon cancer in patients. 651 <lb/>FGFs and FGFRs in tumorigenesis <lb/>FGF/FGFR signaling is involved in the major steps of tumor <lb/>progression, including cancer cell survival and proliferation, angiogen-<lb/>esis, invasion, and metastatic dissemination and response to therapy. <lb/>FGFs and FGFRs in tumor growth. The expression of FGF4 was <lb/>increased in germ cell tumors, especially in non-seminomas, which <lb/>could promote malignant growth of cultured embryonal carcino-<lb/>mas by targeting all-trans-retinoic acid. 652 FGF2 can induce breast <lb/>cancer growth through ligand-independent activation and stimu-<lb/>late the MYC gene expression through recruitment of ERα and PRB <lb/>δ4 isoform to MYC regulatory sequences. 653 The results from <lb/>Betsuyaku, T.&apos;s group showed that the FGF2 aptamer that can <lb/>block FGF2 activity could inhibit the growth of FGF2-FGFR <lb/>pathway-dependent lung cancer cells. 654 Increased expression of <lb/>FGF4 in ovarian cancer stem-like cells/cancer-initiating cells is <lb/>involved in the upregulating tumor initiation capacity of <lb/>fibroblasts. 655 Fang et al. 656 demonstrated that miR-188-5p <lb/>suppressed the tumor cell proliferation and metastasis by directly <lb/>targeting FGF5 in HCC. The neutralizing antibody to FGF8b could <lb/>significantly inhibit cell growth of prostate cancer. 611 In mouse <lb/>Leydig tumor cells, FGF9/FGFR2 signaling can increase its <lb/>proliferation by activating ERK1/2, Rb/E2F1, and cell-cycle path-<lb/>ways. 657 Downregulation of FGF18 suppressed the tumor forma-<lb/>tion abilities, induced G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and enhanced <lb/>anticancer drug sensitivity. 619 The antibody of FGF19 could inhibit <lb/>the growth of colon tumor xenografts in vivo and effectively <lb/>prevent HCCs in FGF19 transgenic mice, suggesting that the <lb/>inactivation of FGF19 could be beneficial treatment for cancers <lb/>and other malignancies involving interaction of FGF19 and <lb/>FGFR4. 658 Low concentration exogenous FGF19 promoted the <lb/>growth of prostate cancer cells, while inhibition of FGF19 in <lb/>prostate cancer cells could decrease proliferation in vitro and <lb/>tumor growth in vivo. 629 FGF9 greatly contributes to Pregnane X <lb/>receptor-mediated tumor aggressiveness in humans and mice. 659 <lb/>In endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced HCC cells, FGF19 over-<lb/>expression promoted cell survival and increased resistance to <lb/>apoptosis, whereas FGF19 silencing counteracted these effects. 660 <lb/>FGF19 gene amplification has been found to be corresponding <lb/>with an increased dependency upon FGF19/FGFR4 autocrine <lb/>signaling mediated by ERK/AKT-p70S6K-S6 activation in head and <lb/>neck squamous cell carcinomas. 661 FGF23 enhances the prolifera-<lb/>tion, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth of prostate <lb/>cancer cell lines in vitro, while FGF23 KD also decreases tumor <lb/>growth in vivo. 626 Activation of FGFR1 leads to rapid tumor growth <lb/>as a result of increased proliferation in prostate cancer cells. 662 <lb/>FGFR2 promotes breast cancer tumorigenicity by maintaining <lb/>tumor-initiating cells. 663 FGFR3 is overexpressed in the early <lb/>stages of bladder cancer, and targeting the extracellular domain of <lb/>FGFR3 with human single-chain Fv antibodies could suppress the <lb/>proliferation of bladder carcinoma cell line. 664 <lb/>FGFs and FGFRs in the invasion and migration tumors. Henriksson <lb/>et al. 665 reported that colorectal cancer cells activate adjacent <lb/>fibroblasts, which results in enhanced FGF1/FGFR3 signaling and <lb/>subsequent increased invasion of tumor cells.

			<body>significantly inhibit cancer cell invasion. 88 FGF7/KGF could trigger <lb/>cell transformation and invasion of immortalized human prostatic <lb/>epithelial PNT1A cells. 666 FGF7/FGFR2/THBS1 promotes the inva-<lb/>sion and migration in human GC. 667 FGF9 secreted by cancer-<lb/>associated fibroblasts is considered as a possible mediator by <lb/>promoting the anti-apoptosis and invasive capability of GC <lb/>cells. 668 FGF10/FGFR2 signal can significantly promote the cell <lb/>migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer. 669 FGF16 enhanced <lb/>the invasion of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells through activation of <lb/>MAPK signaling pathway. 617 The members of FGF8 subfamily <lb/>including FGF8, FGF17, and FGF18 are involved in autocrine and <lb/>paracrine signaling in HCC and enhance the survival of tumor <lb/>cells, tube formation, and neoangiogenesis. 670 FGF18 has been <lb/>reported to control the migration, invasion, and tumorigenicity of <lb/>ovarian cancer cells through NF-κB activation, which increased the <lb/>production of oncogenic cytokines and chemokines. 671 FGF9 <lb/>greatly contributes to Pregnane X receptor-mediated tumor <lb/>aggressiveness in humans and mice. 659 <lb/>FGFs and FGFRs in tumor angiogenesis. The onset of angiogenesis <lb/>is a discrete step that occurs at any stage of tumor progression. <lb/>FGF ligands and receptors promote angiogenesis in a variety of <lb/>tumors. 672 Wang and Becker 673 showed that delivery of an <lb/>episomal vector containing antisense FGF2 or FGFR1 cDNA could <lb/>completely prevent the growth of tumors partially through the <lb/>blockage of angiogenesis in the human melanoma grown as a <lb/>subcutaneous tumor model in nude mice. FGF2 can induce tumor <lb/>growth and neovascularization in vivo. 674 FGF2 and MMP2 may <lb/>cause increased angiogenesis and invasion of bone marrow <lb/>plasma cells in several unidentified monoclonal gamma globulin <lb/>disease and multiple myeloma cases. 675 FGF binding protein can <lb/>be used as an angiogenesis conversion molecule in human tumors <lb/>via promoting the release of biologically active FGF2 and leading <lb/>to tumor growth. 676 The type 1 repeats of thrombospondin-1 <lb/>(TSP1) can block angiogenesis driven by FGF2 or vascular VEGF <lb/>and inhibit tumor growth. 677 IL-10 blocks the proliferation of <lb/>microvascular ECs induced by VEGF and FGF2 in vitro and has a <lb/>direct effect on preventing angiogenesis in human lymphomas. 678 <lb/>It has been reported that the average serum FGF2 level was <lb/>significantly increased (~7 times) in testicular cancer patients, and <lb/>the expression level of FGF2 was also significantly increased in <lb/>tumor biopsies. 679 Targeting the mRNA of early growth response <lb/>(EGR1) an upstream of FGF2, can inhibit the expression of EGR1 <lb/>protein and block tumor angiogenesis. 680 Human melanoma cell <lb/>survival and growth depend on autocrine action of FGF2. 681 In <lb/>addition, neutralized FGF2 with antibodies could block the <lb/>angiogenesis in melanoma cell lines transplanted nude mice <lb/>models. 682 In addition, FGF2 is shown to be involved in <lb/>angiogenesis in the formation of pituitary tumors. 683 FGF1 can <lb/>cause increased angiogenesis that contributes to the poor survival <lb/>rate of patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer. 684 Two <lb/>angiogenic factors PDGF-BB and FGF2 in tumors can synergisti-<lb/>cally promote the neovascularization and metastasis in murine <lb/>tumor model. 685 Targeted inhibition of PDGF receptors can <lb/>downregulate the expression of FGF2 and epithelial growth factor <lb/>FGF7, thereby reducing angiogenesis. 686 <lb/>THERAPEUTICS AND STRATEGIES FOR TARGETING FGF <lb/>SIGNALING <lb/>FGF signaling plays critical roles in tissue/organ development and <lb/>homeostasis, and dysregulated FGF signaling has been found in a <lb/>variety of diseases and injuries (see above). It is a promising <lb/>therapeutic strategy for these diseases/injuries by modifying or <lb/>correcting the aberrant FGF signaling. So far, FGF-based ther-<lb/>apeutics are largely classified into three classes, including <lb/>enhancing FGF signaling therapeutics, blocking FGF signaling <lb/>therapeutics, and gene therapy. <lb/>Enhancing FGF signaling therapeutics <lb/>FGFs are involved in numerous pathophysiological processes; 1 <lb/>recombinant FGF or FGF analogs have been developed as first-<lb/>generation strategies to augment the beneficial effects of FGFs/ <lb/>FGFRs (shown in Table 3). <lb/>Canonical FGFs, encoded by FGF1, FGF4, FGF7, FGF8, and FGF9 <lb/>subfamily gene, by binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans <lb/>largely exert their effects locally. 1 A single injection of mouse <lb/>recombinant FGF1 causes potent, dose-and insulin-dependent <lb/>glucose lowering in diabetic mice without hypoglycemia. 687 <lb/>Recombinant human FGF1 (rhFGF1) is also able to normalize <lb/>blood glucose in diabetic mice. 687 In addition, trafermin (rhFGF2) <lb/>has been supported for their use in the patients with skin <lb/>ulcers, 688 and in phase III clinical trial, trafermin was further <lb/>approved for its application in patients with periodontal surgery. <lb/>Palifermin, a truncated form of FGF7, has been approved for the <lb/>treatment of patients with oral mucositis. 688 In pediatric patients, <lb/>palifermin may provide advantage to prevent chemotherapy-<lb/>induced mucositis. 689 Repifermin, a truncated form of FGF10, with <lb/>the pharmacological effects similar to that of FGF7, promotes the <lb/>healing of ulcerated oral and intestinal mucosal tissue, and <lb/>reduces the complications in preclinical tests. 690 However, the <lb/>clinical trials about the effect of repifermin on mucositis were <lb/>terminated in 2004 as no effective evidence for reducing the <lb/>incidence or severity. 691 In addition, rhFGF18 have been approved <lb/>for treating OA and cartilage injury of the knee in phase II clinical <lb/>trial. 266 <lb/>Endocrine FGFs, encoded by FGF19 subfamily gene, which bind <lb/>and activate FGFRs with the Klotho family protein, regulate a wide <lb/>range of metabolic processes. 692 Based on the structure-function <lb/>principle, separating mitogenic and metabolic activities of FGF19 <lb/>through mutagenesis of five N-terminal and heparin-binding <lb/>regions of FGF19 yielded a series of FGF19 variants, which retain <lb/>the beneficial metabolic effects, while reduce the side effects of <lb/>FGF19 on tumorigenicity. 693 In addition, a new constructed FGF19 <lb/>variant (25-194 of FGF19 and 1-20 of FGF21), impaired in <lb/>activating FGFR4 and still had beneficial effects on glucose and <lb/>lipid metabolism. 694 These studies provide a strategy for <lb/>engineering FGF19 as a potential therapy for related diseases/ <lb/>injuries. These variants were found to be devoid of BA regulatory <lb/>activity. However, another FGF19 variant NGM282 (M70) retains <lb/>the beneficial BA metabolism effects, while is devoid of murine <lb/>mitogenic activity by inactivating the STAT3 pathway. 695 To date, <lb/>M70 as one FGF19 variant was studied through phase II clinical <lb/>trials for their use in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis <lb/>and diabetes mellitus. In addition, several FGF19-inducing <lb/>strategies (farnesoid X receptor agonists) such as obeticholic acid <lb/>and Px-104 were tested through phase II clinical trials and <lb/>provided with further support for their use in the patients with <lb/>primary/secondary BA malabsorption and nonalcoholic fatty liver <lb/>disease, respectively. <lb/>Several strategies have been used to optimize the &quot;druggability&quot; <lb/>of FGF21. LY2405319, a novel FGF21 variant, was reconstructed by <lb/>introducing an additional disulfide bond firstly in the C terminal of <lb/>FGF21 by mutations (L118C, A134C), and then further optimized <lb/>by deleting His-Pro-Ile-Pro in the N terminal of FGF21 along with a <lb/>mutation to replace the major site of O-linked glycosylation <lb/>(Ser167Ala). Subcutaneous administration of LY2405319 in DIO <lb/>mice exhibited a potency similar to FGF21, resulting in decreased <lb/>plasma glucose along with a reduction in body weight. 696 To date, <lb/>LY2405319 has been tested through phase I clinical trial to reduce <lb/>body weight and fasting insulin, and is noteworthy in improving <lb/>dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 697 Another <lb/>FGF21 variant is reconstructed through the introduction of p-<lb/>acetyl phenylalanine into the N-terminal residue of rhFGF21 for <lb/>the attachment of PEG (PEGylated rhFGF21). 698 PEGylated <lb/>rhFGF21 has the ability to normalize insulin-mediated glucose <lb/>utilization in diabetic murine models, 699 but exhibits remarkably <lb/></body>

			<body>lower bioactivity than FGF21, along with induction of renal <lb/>vacuole formation. 700 Song et al. 701 further optimized FGF21 by <lb/>introducing G71C mutation to generate the mimetic PEG-<lb/>FGF21 G71C , which exhibits increased half-life. Subsequently, an <lb/>alternative strategy was adopted to yield Fc-FGF21 by fusing Fc <lb/>fragment of human IgG1 to the N-terminal end of FGF21 to <lb/>improve the pharmacokinetic properties of FGF21, which exhib-<lb/>ited a prominently increased half-life compared to the native <lb/>FGF21. 702 Since, the C-terminal region of Fc-FGF21, especially <lb/>between Pro171 and Ser172, was rapidly degraded, Pro171Gly <lb/>mutation was introduced to retain biological activity, while <lb/>eliminate the proteolytic degradation. 703 Moreover, FGF21 has <lb/>the additional concern of forming aggregates during protein <lb/>production. By combining Pro171Gly and Leu98Arg mutations <lb/>into one molecule, a novel variant named Fc-FGF21 (RG) was <lb/>generated with resistance to aggregation and proteolysis. 703 <lb/>Another approach to improve plasma half-life is to fuse FGF21 <lb/>to a scaffold monoclonal antibody (mAb). 704,705 <lb/>Blocking FGFs signaling therapeutics <lb/>Given that a variety of human diseases and injuries caused by <lb/>excessive FGF signaling. So far, the measures blocking FGF <lb/>signaling can be generally classified to TKIs, neutralizing mAbs, <lb/>and FGF traps. <lb/>TKIs <lb/>Nonselective TKIs: Nonselective TKIs have been developed as <lb/>first-generation strategies to blocking FGFs signaling. These TKIs <lb/>have the benefit of concurrently targeting tumor proliferation and <lb/>angiogenesis, while also displaying a remarkable effect against <lb/>FGFR signaling pathways, together with a multiplicity of adverse <lb/>effects that limit their use in clinic. <lb/>Lucitanib (E3810) is a triple TKI, which targeting FGFRs, VEGFRs, <lb/>and PDGFRs. E3810 showed a promising efficacy and a manage-<lb/>able side effect in patients with both FGF-aberrant or <lb/>angiogenesis-sensitive tumor types. 706 Until 2018, E3810 were <lb/>completed phase II clinical trials, which inhibits the growth of <lb/>tumor by antiangiogenesis. <lb/>Nintedanib (BIBF1120) is another novel triple angiokinase <lb/>inhibitor, with less activity against SRC, RET, and FLT3. 707 BIBF1120 <lb/>competitively binds to the ATP-binding pocket of these receptors, <lb/>and blocks the intracellular signaling critical for the proliferation <lb/>and survival of angiogenesis-related cells. 707 Up-to-date, BIBF1120 <lb/>has been approved for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and as <lb/>a second-line therapy for NSCLC in combination with docetaxel. <lb/>Phase III clinical trials are still ongoing to study the response of <lb/>patients selected for specific FGFR alterations. 708 <lb/>Dovitinib (CHIR258 or TKI258) is an oral ATP-competitive <lb/>multikinase inhibitor that targets FGFRs, VEGFRs, and PDGFRβ. 709 <lb/>TKI258 has a promising inhibitory activity in cell lines with FGFR <lb/>translocations or amplification. 710 In phase II trials, TKI258 can <lb/>stabilize disease in multiple myeloma bearing t (4;14) translocation <lb/>by blocking FGFR3 activity. 711 <lb/>Beyond that, several other nonselective TKIs are shown in Table 3, <lb/>which have been developed and are in preclinical and clinical <lb/>evaluation. 712 However, these nonselective TKIs induce a series of <lb/>side effects: cardiotoxicity or proteinuria on account of the <lb/>concurrent VEGFR inhibition, as well as cutaneous reactions, <lb/>digestive disorders, and gastrointestinal disease, for example. 153 <lb/>Selective TKIs: To overcome the off-target effects, second-<lb/>generation selective FGFR TKIs have been developed. <lb/>AZD4547 is a potent reversible TKI specific for FGFRs. 713 Of note, <lb/>AZD4547 is able to sharply diminish cancer stem-like cells by <lb/>inducing MET via MEK/ERK pathway downstream of FGFR <lb/>signaling. 714 In addition, administered AZD4547 prominently <lb/>impaired ductal branching and stem cell-like characteristics in <lb/>mammary epithelial cell and spontaneous tumor cells. 715 In phase <lb/>I/II trials, AZD4547 further showed promising inhibitory activity in <lb/>models of cancer with FGFR alteration. <lb/>BGJ398 (NVP-BGJ398) is a selective reversible ATP-competitive <lb/>inhibitor targeting FGFRs, which showed superior potency to <lb/>ponatinib and dovitinib, and exerted a more potent therapeutic <lb/>effect against chemotherapy-refractory cholangiocarcinoma con-<lb/>taining FGFR2 fusions. 638 Of note, in phase I/II trials, BGJ398 <lb/>promoted tumor reduction in patients with FGFR-related <lb/>advanced solid tumors. 716 <lb/>JNJ42756493 (erdafitinib) with potent TKI activity can target all <lb/>FGFRs, which suppresses phospho-FGFR and phospho-ERK result-<lb/>ing in dose-dependent antitumor activity. 717 Further in phase I/II <lb/>trials, the administered erdafitinib has an inhibitory activity in <lb/>patients with advanced solid tumors characterized by FGFR <lb/>translocations or FGFR3-TACC3 fusions. 717-719 <lb/>Other selective TKIs are shown in Table 3, and showed <lb/>promising results in preclinical and clinical evaluation on different <lb/>oncotypes. 712 <lb/>Unfortunately, drug resistance limits the success of TKIs with <lb/>mutations at the &quot;gatekeeper&quot; residue, leading to tumor progres-<lb/>sion. Structural analyses showed that the FGFR1 &quot;gatekeeper&quot; <lb/>mutation (V561M) can induce a potently increased autopho-<lb/>sphorylation, in part, by a network of interacting residues forming <lb/>a hydrophobic spine to stabilize the active conformation. Further <lb/>kinetic assays established that V561M confers significant resis-<lb/>tance to E3810, while it retains affinity for AZD4547 due to a <lb/>flexible linker that allows multiple inhibitor binding modes. 720 In <lb/>addition, JNJ42756493 binds to the ATP pocket of the FGFR1 KD <lb/>with unique structural conformations, and its inhibitory efficacy is <lb/>reduced by 200-fold in the FGFR3 &quot;gatekeeper&quot; mutation (V555M), <lb/>while an increase in efficacy for TKI258. 721 In contrast, some FGFR2 <lb/>&quot;gatekeeper&quot; mutations drive acquired resistance to TKI258 by <lb/>causing steric hindrance to the binding of the TKI to the receptor <lb/>(such as N550K, E566G, and K660E) or by stabilizing the active <lb/>conformation of the kinase (V651I). 722 Moreover, multiple <lb/>recurrent patients have point mutations in the FGFR2 KD at <lb/>progression, and each mutation drives acquired resistance to <lb/>BGJ398, and was surmountable by structurally distinct FGFR <lb/>inhibitors. 723 Thus, designing inhibitor with flexibility to overcome <lb/>drug resistance may be an vital way for exploiting effective <lb/>inhibitor against mutation. <lb/>Neutralizing mAbs. When compared to TKIs, neutralizing mAbs <lb/>have unique advantages of low toxicity due to the absence of off-<lb/>target effects. <lb/>Burosumab (formerly KRN23) is a fully human IgG1 mAb that <lb/>binds to and blocks the biologic activity of FGF23. Injection of <lb/>Burosumab normalized both phosphate and vitamin D concentra-<lb/>tions in hypophosphatemia mouse models. 724 In 2019, phase II <lb/>clinical trials for Burosumab was completed and provided support <lb/>for its use for XLH. <lb/>Bemarituzumab (FPA144) is a rhIgG1 mAb that specially binds <lb/>to the IgG III region of the FGFR2b receptor isoform to prevent <lb/>ligand binding and downstream signaling activation. In phase I <lb/>clinical trial, a single dose of FPA144 was conducted in <lb/>gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) patients with FGFR2b <lb/>overexpression, which remarkably inhibited GEA growth. <lb/>MGFR1877S is an mAb targeting FGFR3 by hampering its <lb/>dimerization, which is well tolerated with low toxicities in patients <lb/>with multiple myeloma and solid tumors in phase I clinical <lb/>trials. 708 <lb/>Beyond that, there are other mAbs awaiting further confirma-<lb/>tion in preclinical and clinical testing, such as BAY1179470, hIgG1-<lb/>1A2, GAL-F2, 3F12E7, KM1334, FGF10 mAb, FN1, FC1, and R1MAb1, <lb/>as detailed in Table 3. <lb/>FGF traps. An alternative strategy to modulate the activity of the <lb/>FGF/FGFR signaling is to use the molecules able to bind and <lb/></body>

			<body>neutralize multiple FGF ligands. This strategy represents a novel <lb/>path for the development of FGF traps. <lb/>FP-1039 (GSK3052230) is an FGF ligand trap that binds and <lb/>neutralizes multiple FGFs and thus inhibits the activation of FGFR1. <lb/>In preclinical trials, FP-1039 blocked FGF2-stimulated tumor cell <lb/>proliferation and inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models. 672 <lb/>In phase I clinical trials, associated with paclitaxel and carboplatin, <lb/>or docetaxel, intraperitoneal injection of FP-1039 was well <lb/>tolerated in patients with solid malignancies. 725 However, FP-<lb/>1039 does not effectively inhibit endocrine FGFs (FGF19, FGF21, <lb/>and FGF23). 726 Therefore, FP-1039 has the potential to effectively <lb/>block the neoplasms or advanced cancer-promoting FGFs, with <lb/>less toxicity compared to small molecules such as FGFR kinase <lb/>inhibitor. <lb/>The development of FGF trap agents has also relied on the <lb/>structural characterization of the interactions of FGFs with their <lb/>natural &quot;interactome,&quot; including thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), HSPGs, <lb/>and pentraxin-3 (PTX3). 727 Structural analysis of the complex <lb/>between FGF2 and TSP1 identified a new small-molecule SM27 <lb/>that inhibits FGF2-induced angiogenesis through binding to <lb/>FGF2. 728 Similar to the integrative TSP1, SM27 perturbs FGF2 <lb/>dynamics in distant regions, including the FGFR1 binding site, by <lb/>binding the heparin affinity site of FGF2, thus preventing FGF2 <lb/>binding to HSPG and FGFR1. 729 Therefore, SM27 acts as a dual <lb/>direct and allosteric inhibitor of the binding between FGF2 and its <lb/>receptors, which has unique benefits for the development of <lb/>novel cancer drug. In addition, structural analysis of the complex <lb/>between FGF2 and the N terminal of PTX3 730 identified an <lb/>acetylated pentapeptide ARPCA as the minimal FGF2 binding <lb/>peptide that inhibits FGF8b-induced angiogenesis. 731 Besides, <lb/>based on pharmacophore modeling of the ARPCA/FGF2 interac-<lb/>tion, NSC12 was identified as multi-FGF trap that can participate in <lb/>the formation of the HSPG/FGF2/FGFR1 ternary complex. In tumor <lb/>models, administration of NSC12 can block the growth, angiogen-<lb/>esis, and metastasis of FGF-dependent lung tumors. 732 <lb/>In addition, a soluble FGFR2 mutant with S252W (sFGFR2IIIc <lb/>(S252W)) was found to partially alleviate the AS in mice by <lb/>alleviating the premature closure of coronal suture in cultured <lb/>calvarias and transgenic mice. 733,734 Moreover, sFGFR3, a recom-<lb/>binant protein, acts as a FGFR trap to prevent FGF ligand binding <lb/>to FGFR3. In ACH mice, subcutaneous injection of sFGFR3, to <lb/>compete with endogenous FGFR3 ligands, showed a dose-<lb/>dependent rescue of chondrodysplasia phenotypes. 735 Besides, <lb/>in TD II model, administration of peptide P3 with the ability to <lb/>downregulate the activity of FGFR3 rescues the lethal phenotype <lb/>and partially restores the structural distortion of growth plates. 736 <lb/>Gene therapy <lb/>At present, gene therapy is inevitable, especially in the era of <lb/>precision medicine. Expression of FGF18 by AAV-mediated gene <lb/>transfer in the pinnae of nude mice resulted in a noteworthy <lb/>increased thickness due to an FGF18-mediated increase in <lb/>chondrocyte proliferation and ECM production. 238 Conditional <lb/>expression of FGF18 in stromal cells surrounding proximal airway <lb/>cartilage in normal mouse lung is capable of enhancing proximal <lb/>programs during lung morphogenesis. 737 Up-to-date, only few <lb/>FGF signaling-related gene therapies have entered clinical trials. <lb/>NV1FGF is a plasmid-based angiogenic gene delivery system for <lb/>local expression of FGF1. Intramuscular administration of NV1FGF <lb/>resulted in a noteworthy reduced risk of major amputation in <lb/>patients with critical limb ischemia. 738 In 2017, phase II clinical <lb/>trials for NV1FGF was completed and provided further support for <lb/>its use in patients with severe peripheral artery occlusive disease. <lb/>The above-described molecules such as sFGFR2IIIc <lb/>(S252W) 733,734 or MEK inhibitor 739 or glycosaminoglycans 740 can <lb/>partially alleviate the AS, but may bring undesired effects as they <lb/>do not specifically antagonize the mutant FGFR2 itself. In contrast, <lb/>RNA interference (RNAi) could inhibit the expression of mutant <lb/>alleles at the transcriptional level. A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) <lb/>targeting the dominant mutant form of FGFR2 (FGFR2 (S252W)) <lb/>prevents the phenotypes of AS in mice. 739 Safety and efficiency <lb/>are the two major concerns for the application of RNAi-related <lb/>therapeutics. AAV has unique advantages of gene transfer for <lb/>therapeutic treatment of a number of diseases, including <lb/>congenital blindness, hemophilia, and spinal muscular atro-<lb/>phy. 741,742 Our group screened a siRNA specifically targeting the <lb/>FGFR2-P253R allele, when this siRNA was delivered to the skulls in <lb/>AS mouse model using AAV9 (AAV9-FGFR2-shRNA), it attenuated <lb/>the premature closure of coronal suture and the decreased <lb/>calvaria bone volume. 743 Such biological strategy, in combination <lb/>with other therapies including surgeries, provides experimental <lb/>clues for the biological therapies of other genetic skeletal diseases. <lb/>In recent years, CRISPR/Cas9-based method has been is <lb/>developed for gene therapy. Some studies have verified the <lb/>advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for the correction of human <lb/>hereditary genetic diseases, such as liver diseases, 744 cataract <lb/>disorder, 745 Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 746 tyrosinemia, 747 <lb/>thalassemia, 748 and so forth. Miao et al. 749 found that Cas9 <lb/>protein can achieve higher frequency of precise correction of the <lb/>FGFR3-G374R mutation than Cas9 mRNA. These strategies <lb/>completely suppressed phenotypes of ACH without off-target <lb/>effects checked by whole-genome sequencing. CRISPR/Cas9 <lb/>technology can precisely correct individual mutations with high <lb/>fidelity and is potentially translatable for clinical therapies of <lb/>human diseases, especially genetic diseases in the future. <lb/>CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE <lb/>Knowledge of the role of FGF/FGFR signaling in pathological and <lb/>physiological conditions has advanced considerably in the past <lb/>decades. In this review, we summarized the structure and function <lb/>of FGF signaling molecules and the detailed regulatory mechan-<lb/>isms. FGF/FGFR system contributes to the pathophysiology of <lb/>multiple disorders in humans, including genetic diseases, dysplas-<lb/>tic diseases, various types of cancer, metabolic disorders, and <lb/>degenerative diseases, as well as injuries and regeneration. Much <lb/>remains to be learned. The spatiotemporal expression patterns, <lb/>accurate roles, and underlying mechanisms of individual FGFs/ <lb/>FGFRs in the development and diseases/injuries are largely <lb/>unknown. <lb/>Activation of FGF signaling is tightly controlled with diverse <lb/>transduction specificity, which mainly depends on the molecular <lb/>structures of FGFs/FGFRs. With the advance of multiple disciplines <lb/>including structure biology, we have acquired more information <lb/>about FGFs/FGFRs, such as their structures, binding partners, key <lb/>amino acids mediating the specific binding and signaling path-<lb/>ways. We need to know from the viewpoint of structure why <lb/>individual FGFs have variable binding affinities of respective <lb/>FGFRs; why the same FGF ligand bind distinct group of FGFRs at <lb/>different concentration; the downstream signaling pathways <lb/>activated by individual FGF through respective FGFR at different <lb/>concentrations and in physiological and pathologic circumstance; <lb/>can we switch the binding affinity of individual FGFs, based on <lb/>their structure, to HS and FGFRs to have novel therapeutic effects <lb/>on aberrant FGF signaling-related disease? With this information, <lb/>we will have the possibility to fine tune FGF-related signaling to <lb/>achieve better therapeutic outcome in the future. <lb/>There are complex interactions among individual FGFs and <lb/>FGFRs. Most FGF can bind multiple FGFRs with differential binding <lb/>affinities. So far, there are few studies about the differential <lb/>signaling pathways activated by individual FGF through corre-<lb/>sponding FGFRs. Considering the differential even opposite effects <lb/>of each FGFR in the homeostasis maintenance and occurrence of <lb/>diseases, for example, FGFR1 promotes while FGFR3 suppresses <lb/>OA pathogenesis, the effects of individual FGF on OA and cartilage <lb/>injuries are the summed effects of all signaling pathways of FGFRs <lb/></body>

			<body>activated by the applied FGF. More studies are needed to know <lb/>the individual FGFRs activated by the applied FGFs at specific <lb/>concentrations. <lb/>To obtain these knowledges, we need new strategies such as <lb/>omics technology, single-cell analysis, and in vivo imaging, as well <lb/>as utilization of more species of model animals and more <lb/>spatiotemporally tunable genetic approaches. For example, our <lb/>commonly used strategy to study the role of individual FGFs or <lb/>FGFRs in the disease pathogenesis has limitation. We need to use <lb/>conditional approach to spatiotemporally delete or overexpress <lb/>individual FGFs or FGFRs in a certain type of cells, for example, <lb/>chondrocytes, aimed to dissect the role of individual FGFs or <lb/>FGFRs in the development and maintenance of the targeted cells. <lb/>In addition, it is appreciated that mutations of individual FGFs or <lb/>FGFRs can have detrimental effects, but a systematic under-<lb/>standing of intracellular pathway activation and dynamics is still <lb/>lacking. 750 <lb/>To mimic the effects obtained from omics and conditional <lb/>knockout study, we need to use targeted therapy approaches, <lb/>which means to precisely modulate individual FGFs, FGFRs, and <lb/>downstream signaling in specific types of cells at specific disease <lb/>stages. The good news is that we are having more and more <lb/>approach to exert these targeted treatments. For example, <lb/>aptamer-based cell lineage or tissue targeting approaches are <lb/>increasingly utilized. Several aptamers have been discovered to <lb/>specifically target bone-forming site, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and <lb/>osteocytes in the skeletal tissue. We can similarly find aptamers <lb/>specifically targeting for distinct cells at different growth phases, <lb/>or inflammatory cells, paracancerous, and non-tumorous tissues, <lb/>and so on. <lb/>FGF pathway interacts extensively with other signaling path-<lb/>ways during a variety of development and disease processes. <lb/>Clarifying the interactions among FGF signaling, and these <lb/>signaling pathways, such as BMP/TGF-β, PTH, hedgehog, and <lb/>retinoid pathways, will provide us with the molecular bases for <lb/>searching for combined therapies. 751 <lb/>Interventions targeting FGFs/FGFRs represent new approaches <lb/>for the treatment of a wide range of diseases including genetic <lb/>disorders, cancer, metabolic disease, degenerative disease, and <lb/>injury repair. Developments in this field will likely be facilitated by <lb/>structure-based drug design of agonists and antagonists for FGF <lb/>signaling. <lb/></body>

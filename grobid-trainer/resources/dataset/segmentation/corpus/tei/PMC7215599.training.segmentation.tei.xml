			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and is the second leading cause of death in <lb/>developed nations. The greatest number of deaths are from cancers of the lung, prostate, colon and <lb/>rectum in men and the lung, breast, colon and rectum in women [1]. One of the basic methods of <lb/>cancer treatment is chemotherapy, which uses cytotoxic drugs with systemic effects. Despite years of <lb/>effort in the field of designing different molecules, there are still few selective drugs against cancer cells <lb/>as compared with normal cells [2]. <lb/>The mouse/murine protein, MDM2, a promising target for developing anti-cancer therapies, is an <lb/>important negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein [3,4]. Under normal conditions, the <lb/>MDM2 protein binds to the transactivation domain of p53, preventing its binding to DNA and labelling <lb/></body>

			<body>DNA for proteasomal degradation. In this way, MDM2/p53 interaction reduces p53 abundance in <lb/>normal and untransformed cells [5,6]. Conversely, in several cancer cells, MDM2 has been shown to be <lb/>overexpressed and leads to a loss of the tumor-suppressor function of p53, promoting proliferation, <lb/>survival and growth of the tumor [7-10]. Preclinical data have shown that blocking the MDM2/p53 <lb/>interaction may induce apoptosis in both MDM2-overexpressing and wild-type tumor cell lines [11]. <lb/>Hence, small molecules designed to block the MDM2/p53 interaction can lead to an increase in the <lb/>level of p53 and its transcriptional activation [3]. <lb/>The nutlins are the first class of potent and specific MDM2 small-molecule inhibitors, published <lb/>by Vassilev in 2004. They are analogs of cis-imidazoline and are capable of binding to MDM2 in the <lb/>p53-binding pocket, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells [12]. The most extensively investigated <lb/>molecule belonging to cis-imidazoline derivatives is Nutlin-3a, the most active and potent enantiomer <lb/>of the nutlins family (Figure 1). Preclinical evaluations have widely demonstrated, in both in vitro <lb/>and in vivo tumor models, that Nutlin-3a showed antitumor activity against breast cancer, melanoma, <lb/>retinoblastoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, and hematological malignancies [13]. The nutlins as <lb/>promising compounds, which were entered into clinical trials, became interesting lead structures for <lb/>further chemical modifications. <lb/>Int. J. Mol.

Moreover, compound 22 <lb/>belonged to the benzimidazole series (R 2 = [4-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl] and strongly <lb/>inhibited HCT-116 and HeLa cell line viability (IC50 = 11 µM) with selectivity ratios HaCaT/HCT-116 <lb/>or HeLa equal to 3.1 (Figure 2). <lb/>As shown in Table 1, the HCT-116 cell line presented the relatively highest susceptibility and <lb/>was affected by eighteen compounds 19-26, 28, 30, 31, 34, 37, 38, 40, 42, 45 and 46, in the range of IC50 <lb/>values from 7 to 18 µM. Meanwhile, the HeLa cell line was susceptible towards nine compounds (19-<lb/>23, 30, 38, 40 and 46) with IC50 values of 11-18 µM, and the MCF-7 by four compounds (19, 20, 23 and <lb/>46) with IC50 values ranging between 17 and 19 µM. <lb/>We found that among the series bearing a 4-arylpiperazine moiety, the presence of R 2 = 4-Ph-<lb/>piperazin-1-yl (19, 46), 4-(4-flurophenylpiperazin-1-yl (20), and 4-(4-chlorophenylpiperazin-1-yl (23) <lb/>substituents provided strong cytotoxicity toward all of the tested cell lines with IC50 values in the <lb/>range of 7-19 µM, while replacement of an aryl group by a methyl 18 (R 2 = 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl) <lb/>or phenylsulfonyl moiety 32 (R 2 = 4-(phenylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl) caused a decrease in activity to <lb/>IC50 values of 42-82 µM (18) or the loss of activity (IC50 137-280 µM) for 32 (Table 1). It should be <lb/>mentioned that for the series without the piperazine moiety at position 6 of the 1,3,5-triazine ring 6-<lb/>17, 33-36 and 41-44, the presence of the indoline moiety 9, 34 (R 2 = indolin-1-yl) or anilino group 42 <lb/>(R 2 = PhNH-) resulted in moderate cytotoxic activity toward all tested cell lines (IC50 17-30 µM), at <lb/>the same time showing an increase in activity towards HCT-116 (IC50 17-18 µM) for 34 and 42, <lb/>respectively. On the other hand, replacement of anilino moiety 11 (R 2 = PhNH-) by benzylamino <lb/>group 15 (R 2 = PhCH2NH-) caused a 1.7-fold increase in activity toward HCT-116, as well as a 1.5-<lb/>fold increase toward MCF-7 cells (Table 1). <lb/>Figure 2.

Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) of Cytotoxic Activity <lb/>Correlation between structure and activity was performed according to QSAR methodology. <lb/>Three-dimensional structures of all compounds were obtained by applying a conformational search <lb/>with the LowModeMD method (MOE software) using MMFF94X forcefield (MOE software) followed <lb/>by geometry optimization with the semi empirical PM6 method (MOPAC2016 software).

In the <lb/>next stage, cells were lysed with DMSO and the absorbance of the formazan solution was measured at <lb/>550 nm with a plate reader (1420 multilabel counter, Victor, Jügesheim, Germany). The experiment <lb/>was performed in triplicate. Values are expressed as the mean ± SD of at least three independent <lb/>experiments. Cisplatin was used as a positive control. <lb/>3.4. Molecular Docking <lb/>All the molecular modeling studies were performed using Molecular Operating Environment <lb/>(MOE, 2018) software. The partial charges were calculated automatically. All minimizations were <lb/>performed with MOE until an RMSD gradient of 0.2534 kcal/molÅ with AMBER10 force field (a value <lb/>below 2.0 kcal/molÅ indicates that the docking protocol was validated). <lb/>The X-ray crystallographic structure of MDM2 co-crystalized with Nutlin-3a (PDB ID:5C5A) was <lb/>downloaded from the protein data bank available at the RCSB Protein Data Bank https://www.rcsb.org/. <lb/>For each co-crystallized enzyme, water molecules and ligands that were not involved in the binding <lb/>were removed. The Protonate 3D protocol in MOE with its default options was used to prepare the <lb/>protein. The co-crystallized ligand (Nutlin-3a) was used to define the binding site for docking. The <lb/>Triangle Matcher method was used, where 1000 poses were analyzed together with also redocking <lb/>1000 poses (to optimize docked structures) using the AMBER10 force field. From each obtained <lb/>molecular docking result, five poses with the lowest energy were selected. Then one pose was selected <lb/>that had the most interactions with amino acids in the MDM2 protein binding pocket. The choice of <lb/>poses also took into account the number of interactions with the amino acids with which the known <lb/>MDM2 (pdb: 5C5A) Nutlin-3a protein inhibitor binds. The docking scores, types of interactions and <lb/>the bond lengths are shown in Table 3. <lb/></body>

			<body>4. Conclusions <lb/>We have synthesized a series of novel 2-[(4-amino-6-R 2-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)methylthio]-4-chloro-5-<lb/>methyl-N-(5-R 1 -1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-ylidene)benzenesulfonamide 6-49. <lb/>The obtained <lb/>compounds were tested in vitro for their cytotoxic activity, with the use of the MTT assay, toward <lb/>colon (HCT-116), breast (MCF-7) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines (IC 50 : 7-11µM; 15-24 µM and <lb/>11-18 µM), vs. non-cancerous cells (HaCaT) (IC 50 : 34 µM and 28 µM), respectively. The multiple <lb/>linear regression technique (MLR) was applied to build up the QSAR model for predicting the <lb/>cytotoxic activity of novel compounds, based on different topological (2D) and conformational (3D) <lb/>molecular descriptors. Developed models showed a good predictability and might be useful for <lb/>further development of structurally similar derivatives with better cytotoxic properties. The molecular <lb/>docking studies revealed the possible binding mode of the most active compounds 22 and 46 within <lb/>the active site of the MDM2 protein suggesting that it may be a possible molecular target for the <lb/>tested compounds. <lb/>Supplementary Materials: Supplementary materials can be found at http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/8/2924/s1. <lb/>Author Contributions: Ł.T. and J.S. created the concept and designed the study, Ł.T. synthesized compounds, Ł.T., <lb/>J.S. and B. Ż. analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript, A.K. tested the cytotoxic activity, Ł.T. and K.S. conducted <lb/>QSAR and docking studies.

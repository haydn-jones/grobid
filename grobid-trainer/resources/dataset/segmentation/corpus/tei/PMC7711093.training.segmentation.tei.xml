			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Lipids are a key component of life. They play essential roles in membrane structure, cell signaling <lb/>and energy production. Like other biomolecules, they undergo chemical modifications that expand <lb/>their functional repertoire. One modification that has been steadily gaining attention is lipid <lb/>oxygenation, with interest being attributed to two factors: advances in analytical methods that allow <lb/>detection of oxygenated species, and the ever-growing body of literature implicating them in <lb/>biological processes and disease. &quot;Enzymatically oxidized lipids&quot; constitute a large portion of known <lb/>oxygenated lipid mediators, being bioactive lipids that are produced locally through specific <lb/></body>

			<body>biosynthetic pathways in response to extracellular stimuli. Those <lb/>derived from oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) <lb/>such as arachidonic acid (AA) include prostaglandins (PG), <lb/>thromboxanes and leukotrienes, which function in modulating <lb/>inflammation, the immune response, and hemostasis, and are <lb/>broadly termed &quot;oxylipins&quot; (1, 2). Oxylipins also include <lb/>multiply oxygenated derivatives of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) <lb/>and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), of which specific enantiomers <lb/>have been termed &quot;specialized pro-resolving mediators&quot; (SPM) <lb/>for their proposed roles in the resolution of inflammation (3). <lb/>SPMs derived from DHA include D-resolvins, maresins and <lb/>protectin. On the other hand, E-resolvins are proposed to be <lb/>generated from EPA but the enzymatic pathways are unclear and <lb/>require further investigation. Oxylipins also constitute a core <lb/>functional group on larger lipids including oxidized <lb/>phospholipids (oxPL), endocannabinoids and cholesteryl esters <lb/>(CE). Oxidized CEs are conversely associated with <lb/>atherosclerosis progression (4), whereas enzymatically oxidized <lb/>phospholipids (eoxPL) are pro-coagulant and promote a variety <lb/>of innate immune actions in leukocytes and platelets (5). <lb/>Enzymatically oxidized lipids are not limited to those <lb/>containing oxygenated PUFA functional groups. Oxidized <lb/>derivatives of cholesterol include steroid hormones, bile acids <lb/>and their oxysterol precursors. Steroid hormones regulate <lb/>multiple physiological processes including metabolism (e.g., <lb/>glucose homeostasis by glucocorticoids), water retention, <lb/>immune function, and development of sex characteristics (6-<lb/>8). Bile acids, while traditionally known for aiding in fat digestion <lb/>and bilirubin excretion, are also being increasingly revealed as <lb/>signaling molecules and metabolic regulators (9, 10). Similarly, <lb/>accumulating evidence is revealing oxysterols as more than just <lb/>bile acid intermediates with functions in signaling (11). <lb/>Enzymatic lipid oxidation is facilitated by a network of proteins <lb/>that use PUFAs or sterols as substrates, specifically, lipoxygenase <lb/>(LOX), cyclooxygenase (COX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP), all of <lb/>which exist as several isoforms exhibiting broad substrate specificity <lb/>(12-16). In general, PUFA oxygenation is initiated by COXs, LOXs, <lb/>and to a lesser extent CYPs. For example, the biosynthesis of PGs is <lb/>initiated by COXs, whereas the formation of leukotrienes begins <lb/>with a LOX. Additionally, crossover between COX, LOX, and CYP <lb/>is proposed to produce various SPMs. On the other hand, <lb/>cholesterol oxidation is dominated by CYPs. For example, <lb/>sidechain shortening during steroid hormone synthesis is <lb/>catalyzed by CYP11A1 (P450scc). Bile acids are synthesized from <lb/>cholesterol predominantly by two pathways: the neutral pathway <lb/>starting with an endoplasmic reticulum resident enzyme CYP7A1, <lb/>and the acidic pathway starting with CYP27A1 in mitochondria <lb/>(17). CYPs account for many enzymes in both pathways, catalyzing <lb/>the formation of oxysterols as well as oxygenated PUFAs. Last, aldo-<lb/>keto reductases (AKR) and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSD) <lb/>catalyze key redox reactions in bile acid and steroid <lb/>hormone biosynthesis. <lb/>By contrast, non-enzymatically oxidized lipids are produced <lb/>through uncontrolled oxidation via free radical mechanisms. <lb/>This involves the oxidation of lipids by free radicals, followed by <lb/>chain propagation and ultimately termination. Notably, during <lb/>oxygenation of PUFA, active site intermediates can escape to <lb/>react in an uncontrolled manner, leading to some oxidized lipids <lb/>forming due to non-enzymatic rearrangements of enzymatic <lb/>pathway intermediates. <lb/>Here, we provide an overview of major enzymes involved in <lb/>lipid metabolism, including LOXs, COXs, CYPs and AKRs. Then <lb/>we outline the biosynthetic pathways of oxylipins, oxPLs, <lb/>oxysterols, bile acids and steroid hormones. Finally, we address <lb/>outstanding questions and suggest directions for future work. <lb/>ENZYME FAMILIES INVOLVED IN THE <lb/>BIOSYNTHESIS OF OXIDIZED LIPIDS <lb/>Lipoxygenase (LOX) <lb/>Human LOX: Isoforms and Tissue Distribution <lb/>Lipoxygenases (LOX) are a family of non-heme iron-containing <lb/>dioxygenases. They catalyze the stereospecific addition of <lb/>dioxygen to lipids containing a (1Z,4Z)-pentadiene group <lb/>producing lipid hydroperoxides. The human genome contains <lb/>six functional LOX genes, expressed in various tissues (Table 1). <lb/>LOXs were traditionally named according to their positional <lb/>specificity for arachidonic acid (AA). However, the latest <lb/>characterized member eLOX3 has limited lipoxygenase activity <lb/>(38), while some LOXs show preference for other PUFA. <lb/>Sequence analysis of human LOXs (using UniProt entries (39)) <lb/>shows that 12R-LOX (ALOX12B) is evolutionarily closer to 15-<lb/>LOX-2 (ALOX15B; 48.2% identity) than 12S-LOX (ALOX12; <lb/>35.7% identity). Additionally, human 15-LOX-1 (ALOX15) <lb/>exhibits dual positional specificity which is not reflected in the <lb/>name (18). The lack of a robust naming system is a common <lb/>cause of confusion. Thus, the use of gene names alongside <lb/>enzyme names is recommended (14). <lb/>LOXs are typically constitutively expressed, except for 15-<lb/>LOX-1 (ALOX15) which is inducible by IL-4 and IL-13 in <lb/>monocyte-derived macrophages (28). Although 15-LOX-2 <lb/>(ALOX15B) is constitutively expressed in the same cell type, its <lb/>expression can be increased by cytokines, hypoxia, and <lb/>lipopolysaccharide. It is possible that other constitutively <lb/>expressed LOXs share this property. <lb/>Structure and Membrane Association <lb/>of Mammalian LOXs <lb/>There are a limited number of published crystal structures for <lb/>mammalian LOXs. Available structures of 5-and 15-LOXs show <lb/>a single polypeptide chain that consists of two domains: a small <lb/>b-barrel N-terminal domain and a larger a-helix-rich C-terminal <lb/>domain containing the catalytic non-heme iron (40-42). The <lb/>coordination positions of the catalytic iron are occupied by three <lb/>conserved His residues, the carboxyl group of the C-terminus Ile <lb/>residue, a water molecule and one last variable ligand (water, His, <lb/>Asn, or Ser). Studies on mammalian LOXs found that the N-<lb/>terminal domain is not required for catalytic activity, but instead <lb/>functions in membrane binding and regulation (43, 44). The N-<lb/>terminal domain of mammalian 5-LOXs (ALOX5) was found to <lb/>be important for the calcium-dependent translocation from the <lb/></body>

			<body>cytosol or nucleus (depending on cell type) to the nuclear <lb/>envelope and enzyme activity (45, 46). Similar findings were <lb/>reported for mammalian 15-LOXs, with the translocation from <lb/>the cytosol to the cell membrane instead (47, 48). Unlike other <lb/>LOXs, the activity of 5-LOX requires interaction with partner <lb/>proteins 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), coactosin-<lb/>like protein (CLP) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA 2 ) (49, <lb/>50). Additionally, 5-LOX undergoes phosphorylation at multiple <lb/>sites, regulating its translocation and activity, and is allosterically <lb/>activated by ATP (51-53). <lb/>On the other hand, 15-LOXs do not require accessory proteins <lb/>for free FA oxygenation. Instead, 15-LOXs form a complex with a <lb/>small scaffolding protein, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding <lb/>protein 1 (PEPB1) (54). This complex facilitates 15-LOX activity <lb/>on PL-esterified PUFA and is proposed to play regulatory roles in <lb/>ferroptosis along with GPX. PEPB1 has been suggested to direct 15-<lb/>LOX activity toward PL substrates when free AA is depleted (55). <lb/>The crystal structure of human 15-LOX-2 (ALOX15B) revealed a <lb/>hydrophobic loop in the N-terminal domain that is flanked by <lb/>calcium binding sites, a feature that is absent in 5-LOX (42). <lb/>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry showed a <lb/>decrease in H/D exchange for the hydrophobic loop, supporting a <lb/>role in membrane hopping (48, 56). Both 5-LOX and 15-LOXs <lb/>associate with membranes in a calcium-dependent process but they <lb/>exhibit differences in activity, translocation and binding partners. <lb/>Calcium-dependent membrane association has also been <lb/>shown for platelet 12S-LOX (ALOX12), and more recently, <lb/>12R-LOX (ALOX12B), and eLOX3 (19, 57). The activity of <lb/>12S-LOX (ALOX12) is thought to be regulated by the <lb/>availability of its substrates, which are supplied through the <lb/>action of phospholipases. It is currently unknown whether <lb/>12S-LOX is regulated by other mechanisms. Research on the <lb/>regulation of 12R-LOX and eLOX3 is also limited, although <lb/>calcium has been shown to increase the activity of mouse 12R-<lb/>LOX but not eLOX3 (58). <lb/>Aside from the catalytic domain of 12S-LOX (ALOX12), no <lb/>crystal structures are available for 12-LOXs or eLOX3. However, <lb/>human platelet 12S-LOX (ALOX12) was characterized using <lb/>small-angle x-ray scattering, showing its occurrence as a dimer <lb/>in solution (59). This challenged the idea that all human LOXs <lb/>exist and function as monomers. Human 5-LOX displays full <lb/>activity as a monomer but forms functional dimers as well, <lb/>thought to exist in equilibrium (60). Similarly, rabbit 15-LOX-<lb/>1 (ALOX15) undergoes ligand-induced dimerization in aqueous <lb/>solutions, and molecular dynamics predicts stable dimers in the <lb/>presence of substrate fatty acids (61). This supports the idea of <lb/>monomer-dimer equilibria in LOXs. Human 15-LOX-1 (81.1% <lb/>sequence identity to rabbit) likely exhibits the same property. <lb/>In summary, all six human LOXs associate with membranes <lb/>in a calcium-dependent manner. 5-LOX requires the help of <lb/>protein partners for membrane translocation and activity, <lb/>whereas 15-LOXs only require a partner protein to efficiently <lb/>catalyze the oxygenation of PL-esterified PUFA. Less is known <lb/>about the regulation of 12-LOXs and eLOX3. Dimerization and <lb/>monomer-dimer equilibria have been observed in several LOX <lb/>isoforms and represent a potential regulatory mechanism. <lb/>Finally, complete crystal structures have yet to be reported for <lb/>12S-LOX, 12R-LOX, and eLOX3. In the case of 12S-LOX, a <lb/>crystal structure would be beneficial in the rational design of <lb/>inhibitors, as the enzyme functions in platelet activation. <lb/>Reaction Mechanism of LOX <lb/>The dioxygenase activity of LOX represents a highly controlled <lb/>form of lipid peroxidation (Figure 1A). First, stereospecific <lb/>hydrogen atom removal is carried out by the non-heme ferric <lb/>iron [Fe(III)]. Fe(III) is not a strong enough oxidizer to abstract <lb/>hydrogen directly. Thus, a mechanism involving proton-coupled <lb/>electron transfer (PCET) has been proposed (62) (Figure 1A). In <lb/>this, the electron is directly transferred to Fe(III) and the proton <lb/>is picked up by the hydroxide ligand in a concerted mechanism <lb/>(simultaneously), producing a lipid alkyl radical and ferrous iron <lb/>[Fe(II)]. This is followed by a rearrangement of the lipid radical <lb/>into the more stable conjugated diene. After that, dioxygen is <lb/>introduced onto the opposite side of the removed hydrogen <lb/>(antarafacially), generating a lipid peroxyl radical. Finally, the <lb/>lipid peroxyl radical is reduced by Fe(II) and protonated to form <lb/>a lipid hydroperoxide, through PCET. This reforms Fe(III) for <lb/>another round of catalysis. <lb/>TABLE 1 | Human LOXs: Genes, substrates, and major expression sites. <lb/>Gene <lb/>Protein <lb/>Preferred substrate(s) <lb/>Expression sites <lb/>Refs. <lb/>ALOX12 <lb/>12S-LOX <lb/>DHA &amp; EPA &gt; AA <lb/>Platelets, umbilical vein endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, <lb/>skin epidermis <lb/>(18-22), <lb/>ALOX12B 12R-LOX <lb/>O-Linoleoyl-w-hydroxyceramide <lb/>AA &amp; 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid &gt; <lb/>GLA <lb/>Hair roots, keratinocytes, B-cells, tonsil epithelial cells, bronchial epithelial <lb/>cells <lb/>(23-27) <lb/>ALOX15 <lb/>15-LOX-1 <lb/>(12/15 LOX murine <lb/>ortholog) <lb/>DHA &gt; EPA &gt; AA <lb/>Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, reticulocytes, <lb/>tracheal epithelium <lb/>(18, 28-32) <lb/>ALOX15B 15-LOX-2 <lb/>(8-LOX <lb/>murine ortholog) <lb/>DHA &gt; EPA &gt; AA <lb/>Macrophages, hair roots, prostate, lung, cornea, skin <lb/>(18, 28, 33), <lb/>ALOX5 <lb/>5-LOX <lb/>AA &amp; 5S-HpETE <lb/>Leukocytes, dendritic cells, mast cells, lung, placenta <lb/>(34-36) <lb/>ALOXE3 <lb/>eLOX3 <lb/>9R-Hydroperoxy-linoleoyl-w-<lb/>hydroxyceramide <lb/>12R-HpETE <lb/>Skin epidermis <lb/>(25, 37) <lb/>AA arachidonic acid DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; GLA, g-linolenic acid; HpETE, hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid. <lb/></body>

			<body>The stereo and regio-specificity of lipoxygenation are <lb/>determined by structural features which: (i) accommodate and <lb/>position the substrate in a specific orientation, and (ii) direct <lb/>radical rearrangement and oxygen insertion. These features <lb/>include a U-shaped cavity that accommodates the substrate <lb/>(63), a migration channel for oxygen (64), a glycine/alanine <lb/>&quot;switch&quot; that determines stereospecificity by directing oxygen <lb/>(65), and several amino acid residues that control positional <lb/>specificity (66, 67). These properties are explored in-depth by <lb/>Newcomer and Brash (68). <lb/>In addition to classical dioxygenase activity, LOXs catalyze <lb/>other reactions that involve free-radical processes like hydrogen <lb/>abstraction, homolytic bond cleavage, and radical rearrangement <lb/>(69). eLOX3 exhibits a hydroperoxide isomerase activity <lb/>(lipohydroperoxidase activity) which converts hydroperoxides <lb/>to epoxy-alcohols and ketones (70) (Figure 1B). eLOX3 has <lb/>restricted dioxygenase activity (38), and its hydroperoxide <lb/>isomerase activity is considered its primary catalytic reaction. <lb/>Also, mammalian 5-LOXs and human 15-LOX-1 (ALOX15) <lb/>possess leukotriene A 4 synthase activity which produces <lb/>epoxides from hydroperoxides (71-74). The mechanism <lb/>involves the homolytic cleavage of a hydroperoxide into an <lb/>alkoxy radical and hydrogen atom removal (via PCET) from a <lb/>bis-allylic methylene carbon generating an alkyl radical. The <lb/>resulting biradical is stabilized by epoxide formation <lb/>(Figure 1C). <lb/>LOXs are inactive in their basal form with Fe(II) and require <lb/>activation via oxidation into Fe(III) (Figure 1D). LOX activation <lb/>is facilitated by hydroperoxides such as their dioxygenase <lb/>reaction products. Although the proposed LOX catalytic cycle <lb/>regenerates the ferric iron for another round of catalysis, small <lb/>amounts of radical intermediates can escape the active site <lb/>resulting in an incomplete catalytic cycle and requiring <lb/>repeated activation of the enzyme (formation of Fe(III) by <lb/>hydroperoxide) for sustained catalysis (69, 75, 76). <lb/>Some LOXs exhibit suicide inactivation, a property in which <lb/>the reaction product rapidly inactivates the enzyme. Human 5-<lb/>LOX is irreversibly inactivated by both of its products 5-HpETE <lb/>and leukotriene A 4 (77). Similarly, rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX <lb/>(human 15-LOX-1 ortholog) is inactivated by its product 15-<lb/>HpETE, and the mechanism is suggested to be through <lb/>formation of reactive intermediates that covalently bind the <lb/>enzyme (78). The dioxygenase reaction and the other two <lb/>activities (lipohydroperoxidase and leukotriene synthase) have <lb/>been proposed to inactive LOXs through different mechanisms, <lb/>but the mechanistic details remain unclear (78). <lb/>LOXs Act on a Broad Range of Substrates <lb/>LOX isoforms have different substrate preferences. Substrates of <lb/>mammalian 5-LOXs include AA, its hydroperoxide product 5S-<lb/>HpETE, as well as epoxy-alcohols derived from EPA and DHA <lb/>(71, 79). The former two are important in the biosynthesis of <lb/>leukotrienes, while the latter two are proposed to be precursors of <lb/>E-and D-series resolvins, respectively (75, 80). 15-LOXs <lb/>(ALOX15 and ALOX15B) accept AA, EPA, DHA, linoleic acid <lb/>(LA), and g-linolenic acid (GLA) as substrates. The preference of <lb/>human 15-LOX orthologs is: DHA &gt; EPA &gt; AA &gt; GLA &gt; LA <lb/>(18). One key difference is that 15-LOX-1 (ALOX15) possesses <lb/>dual positional specificity for some of its substrates (e.g., 12 and <lb/>15-lipoxygenase activities for AA), whereas 15-LOX-2 <lb/>(ALOX15B) exhibits singular specificity (15-lipoxygenase <lb/>activity) (55). The hydroperoxide isomerase and epoxidase <lb/>activities of 15-LOX-1 (ALOX15) are proposed to function in <lb/>the synthesis of eoxins, E-series resolvins, and protectin from <lb/>their respective precursors. Additionally, human 15-LOX-1 <lb/>oxygenates PUFA-containing fatty amides and 2-arachidonoyl-<lb/>glycerol ester (81, 82). Finally, mammalian 15-LOXs can catalyze <lb/>the oxygenation of PUFA in lysophospholipids (lysoPL), PLs, <lb/>CEs, and lipoproteins (83-88). <lb/>PUFA substrates of platelet 12S-LOX (ALOX12) include AA, <lb/>EPA, DHA, and dihomo-g-linolenic acid (DGLA) (18, 89). While <lb/>no single study has compared all substrates at the same time, one <lb/>determined the order of preference for the first three substrates <lb/>to be: DHA &gt; EPA &gt; AA (18). Another found comparable kinetic <lb/>parameters for EPA, AA, and DGLA as substrates (89). Both <lb/>observed a singular positional specificity for 12S-LOX. LA, GLA, <lb/>and a-linolenic acid (ALA) were all found to be poor substrates <lb/>for 12S-LOX (18, 89, 90). Furthermore, human 12S-LOX <lb/>possesses lipoxin synthase activity, which converts leukotriene <lb/>A 4 into lipoxins A and B (91). The enzymatic activities of 12S-<lb/>LOX are also proposed to function in the biosynthesis of <lb/>hepoxilins and maresins (92, 93). Recently, 12S-LOX was <lb/>shown to oxygenate 2-AA-lysoPL, proposing alternate <lb/>pathways for oxylipin and oxPL biosynthesis (94). <lb/>Mammalian 12R-LOX (ALOX12B) and eLOX3 (ALOXE3) are <lb/>co-expressed in skin and their functions are related. 12R-LOX <lb/>efficiently catalyzes the peroxidation of AA, DGLA and GLA, and <lb/>less efficiently LA, EPA and DHA (23, 24). Later, 12R-LOX was <lb/>shown to oxygenate LA esterified to w-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine <lb/>more efficiently than free LA (25). The hydroperoxide product of <lb/>this reaction is further converted into an epoxy-alcohol by the <lb/>isomerase activity of eLOX3. These two reactions are essential for <lb/>the proper formation of the water-impermeable barrier in <lb/>corneocytes (25). Human eLOX3 isomerase activity has also been <lb/>observed on the 12R-and 12S-hydroperoxides of AA, with the <lb/>reaction occurring 2-3 times faster for the R-stereoisomer (95). <lb/>These reactions produce hepoxilins, which play a role in skin <lb/>inflammation. Curiously, mouse 12R-LOX and eLOX3 metabolize <lb/>the methyl esters of AA and LA more efficiently than the <lb/>unmodified FAs (58). However, human and mouse orthologs are <lb/>known to exhibit differences in substrate preference and regio-<lb/>specificity (95). Thus, further work is needed to assess the ability of <lb/>human 12R-LOX to metabolize fatty methyl esters and whether that <lb/>reaction is biologically relevant. <lb/>Several aspects of LOX enzymology remain unresolved. First, <lb/>the functional implications of suicide inactivation are unknown, <lb/>that is, the reason why some LOXs have not evolved to resist <lb/>suicide inactivation. This suggests a biological function for this <lb/>property, perhaps in regulation. Additionally, the mechanistic <lb/>details of suicide inactivation are not fully understood. Second, <lb/>due to the ever-increasing list of LOX substrates, it has been <lb/>difficult to pinpoint biologically relevant substrates and assign <lb/></body>

			<body>clear functions to all LOX isoforms. For example, the function of <lb/>15-LOX-2 (ALOX15B) in macrophages remains unclear, <lb/>although it has been recently shown to regulate cholesterol <lb/>levels (96). Unique substrates of each isoform (e.g., CEs for 15-<lb/>LOXs, lysoPLs for 12S-LOX) might be worth investigating. <lb/>Cyclooxygenase (COX) <lb/>Human COX: Isoforms and Tissue Distribution <lb/>Cyclooxygenases (COXs), also called prostaglandin-<lb/>endoperoxide synthases and prostaglandin G/H synthases, are <lb/>heme-containing enzymes that possess both oxygenase and <lb/>peroxidase activities. There are two COX genes in humans: <lb/>PTGS1 and PTGS2, which encode for COX-1 and COX-2, <lb/>respectively. Traditionally, it was thought that COX-1 is <lb/>constitutively expressed, whereas COX-2 is inducible in <lb/>response to inflammatory signals. However, several studies <lb/>suggest constitutive COX-2 expression in the brain, lungs, gut, <lb/>thymus, kidneys, and blood vessels (97-99). In the vasculature, <lb/>COX-2 has been demonstrated to be a key source of vascular <lb/>prostacyclin (100, 101). COX-1 is ubiquitously expressed in the <lb/>body, and its expression sites include blood vessels, prostate, <lb/>immune cells (monocytes, T-cells), platelets, stomach, resident <lb/>inflammatory cells, smooth muscles, and mesothelium of many <lb/>organs (102-105). On the other hand, COX-2 is inducible in <lb/>many tissues including prostate, immune cells (T-cells, B-cells, <lb/>monocytes), and stomach (102-104, 106), but also constitutively <lb/>expressed in some tissues as previously mentioned. <lb/>Structure of COX <lb/>The role of COXs as mediators of inflammation and their <lb/>potential as drug targets were drivers for the elucidation of <lb/>their structures. The crystal structure of sheep COX-1 has been <lb/>solved in the presence and absence of various synthetic ligands <lb/>(107-109). Similarly, there are available structures for mouse <lb/>COX-2 in the presence and absence of natural and synthetic <lb/>ligands (13, 110-113), as well as human COX-2 with several <lb/>inhibitors (114, 115). <lb/>Both COX isoforms are homodimers, and this quaternary <lb/>structure is necessary for enzymatic activity (116). Each <lb/>monomer consists of three domains: An N-terminal epidermal <lb/>growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a membrane binding domain, <lb/>and a large C-terminal catalytic domain. The EGF-like domain is <lb/>located at the dimer interface and potentially facilitates <lb/>dimerization. It is also thought to facilitate membrane binding <lb/>(117). The membrane binding domain consists of four <lb/>amphipathic a-helices that insert into one face of a membrane <lb/>bilayer. Both COXs are found on the luminal face of the <lb/>endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the inner and outer nuclear <lb/>membranes (118). However, COX-2 is also found in the Golgi <lb/>apparatus (119). The catalytic domain (in both isoforms) <lb/>contains separate oxygenase and peroxidase active sites on <lb/>opposite sides of the heme cofactor. The oxygenase active site <lb/>is located towards the membrane binding face at the end of a <lb/>hydrophobic tunnel that allows substrate entry, whereas the <lb/>peroxidase active site is in a groove on the opposite face of the <lb/>enzyme (120). <lb/>COXs undergo N-glycosylation at multiple asparagine <lb/>residues. This facilitates their proper folding, and regulates the <lb/>turnover of COX-2 by controlling its trafficking between the ER <lb/>and the Golgi apparatus (119, 121, 122). COX-2 can also be S-<lb/>nitrosylated by inducible nitric oxide synthase, which has been <lb/>proposed to enhance its activity (123). In vitro experiments on <lb/>recombinant human COX-1 and COX-2 demonstrated that both <lb/>isoforms can be S-nitrosylated by a nitric oxide donor, but only <lb/>COX-2 showed increased cyclooxygenase activity (124). Circular <lb/>dichroism data suggest an altered, less dynamic conformation for <lb/>both isoforms after S-nitrosylation with less a-helices, turns, and <lb/>random coils, but more b-sheets. The structural change was <lb/>more pronounced in COX-2 compared to COX-1. These <lb/>findings provide new insight into the structural dynamics of <lb/>COXs. The occurrence and biological relevance of this altered <lb/>COX conformation is unexplored in vivo and would benefit from <lb/>further investigation. <lb/>Although COXs are sequence homodimers, they are <lb/>considered conformational heterodimers because one <lb/>monomer functions as the catalytic subunit (E cat ) and the <lb/>other as an allosteric regulator (E allo ) (125-127). For both COX <lb/>isoforms, the binding of one heme molecule to E cat is required for <lb/>full activity. Several substrate and non-substrate FAs can bind <lb/>E allo to regulate the activity of E cat , and the two COX isoforms <lb/>exhibit differences in this regard. COX-1 is inhibited by palmitic <lb/>acid, stearic acid, margaric acid and oleic acid (127), none of <lb/>which are COX substrates. On the other hand, COX-2 is <lb/>stimulated by palmitic acid and stearic acid (126). Substrate <lb/>FAs (like AA and EPA) also bind to E allo to regulate COX <lb/>activity, with notable differences in the responses of the two <lb/>isoforms (reviewed in (128)). <lb/>Catalytic Mechanism of COX <lb/>COXs possess two enzymatic activities: a dioxygenase activity <lb/>and a peroxidase activity. The dioxygenase activity is a controlled <lb/>peroxidation process (129), and the role of the enzyme is to <lb/>direct hydrogen abstraction and the stereochemistry of <lb/>formation of intermediates (120). Unlike LOXs where <lb/>hydrogen abstraction is carried out by a non-heme associated <lb/>Fe(III), hydrogen abstraction in COX is carried out by a catalytic <lb/>tyrosyl radical (Figure 2A). The heme group oxidizes a tyrosine <lb/>residue in the active site into a radical, which then abstracts a <lb/>hydrogen (stereo-and regio-specifically) from the (1Z,4Z)-<lb/>pentadiene group of the lipid. Using AA as an example <lb/>substrate, the 13-pro-S hydrogen is abstracted. The resulting <lb/>alkyl radical rearranges into a conjugated diene before the <lb/>addition of dioxygen at C11, generating a peroxyl radical (11R-<lb/>stereochemistry). Rotation of the peroxyl radical positions the <lb/>outer oxygen atom in the correct orientation to attack the C9 <lb/>carbon resulting in an endoperoxide (130). A second cyclization <lb/>involving C8 and C12 generates a bicyclic ring and a radical at <lb/>C15. Note that the cyclopentane ring is formed in the trans <lb/>configuration (131). This differs from the non-enzymatically <lb/>generated isoprostanes which occur predominantly in the cis <lb/>configuration (132). Following the second cyclization, dioxygen <lb/>is added onto the si face of the C15, forming a peroxyl radical <lb/>(15S-stereochemistry). Hydrogen atom transfer from the active <lb/></body>

			<body>site tyrosine residue forms prostaglandin G 2 (PGG 2 ) and <lb/>regenerates the tyrosyl radical for another round of catalysis. <lb/>The peroxidase activity of COX reduces PGG 2 into PGH 2 <lb/>(Figure 2A). The mechanism involves a two-electron reduction <lb/>of the hydroperoxide into an alcohol, with a corresponding <lb/>oxidation of the heme group into the oxoferryl form (133) <lb/>(Figure 2B). Regeneration of the heme group can be achieved <lb/>by two sequential one-electron reductions. The peroxidase <lb/>activity is required for the dioxygenase activity as the oxidation <lb/>of the tyrosine into a radical is done by the oxoferryl-porphyrin <lb/>cation radical generated during the peroxidase reaction cycle <lb/>(133) (Figure 2B).

			<body>reduction by peroxidase) leads to the formation of 11R-HETE <lb/>(HETE: hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid), 15R-HETE and 15S-<lb/>HETE (minor product compared to 15R-HETE in both <lb/>isoforms) (137). C11 and C15 are the same oxygen insertion <lb/>sites in the dioxygenase (cyclooxygenase reaction), and these by-<lb/>products are thought to arise from alternate conformations of <lb/>substrate in the active site (138). <lb/>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is an inhibitor of COXs, and its <lb/>mechanism of action involves the acetylation of a serine residue <lb/>(Ser530 in COX-2) in the active site. Acetylation of COX-1 leads <lb/>to complete inhibition (139), whereas the acetylation of COX-2 <lb/>promotes the lipoxygenase-type reaction and the formation of <lb/>15R-HETE (140). It was previously thought that acetylation <lb/>completely inhibits PG production by COX-2 (cyclooxygenase <lb/>reaction). However, recent evidence shows that the acetylated <lb/>enzyme retains that activity (15S-PG formation) but also more <lb/>favorably forms 15R-PGs (141), although PGs are still minor <lb/>products compared to 15R-HETE for acetylated-COX-2. These <lb/>findings are consistent with an earlier study that reported the <lb/>formation of 15R-PGE 2 in COX-2 Ser530 mutants (137). Thus, <lb/>both acetylation and mutagenesis of Ser530 in COX-2 promote <lb/>15R-PG formation. <lb/>COX Isoforms Differ in Their Substrate Specificity <lb/>COXs catalyze the transformation of AA into PGH 2 , which is a <lb/>precursor of other PGs (PGD 2, PGE 2 , PGF 2a , PGI 2 ) and <lb/>thromboxane. These oxygenated AA derivatives are generated <lb/>through the action of tissue-specific enzymes downstream of <lb/>COX (discussed in section 3.1) and play roles in inflammation, <lb/>blood flow regulation and blood clotting through interactions <lb/>with specific GPCRs (142). <lb/>COXs also accept other PUFAs as substrates including <lb/>DGLA, LA, ALA, EPA, and GLA (143), at least in vitro. An <lb/>early study determined the efficiency of substrate utilization for <lb/>human COXs (K cat /K m ) to be AA &gt; DGLA &gt; LA &gt; ALA, with <lb/>ALA being a poor substrate for COX-1. EPA and GLA are poor <lb/>substrates for both isoforms but they are better substrates for <lb/>COX-2 than for COX-1 (143). Later studies have tested other <lb/>PUFAs like eicosadienoic acid, adrenic acid, docosapentaenoic <lb/>acid and DHA as COX substrates (127, 144). In general, COX-2 <lb/>was found to be more efficient than COX-1 for a broader range of <lb/>PUFAs. That said, AA is the preferred substrate for both <lb/>isoforms, but COX-2 can oxygenate it at lower concentrations <lb/>compared to COX-1 due to differences in their allosteric <lb/>regulation by FAs (145). <lb/>COX-2 can also catalyze the 11R-, 15R-, 15S-dioxygenation and <lb/>bis-oxygenation of 5S-HETE, forming diHETEs in the former three <lb/>reactions and a di-endoperoxide product in the later reaction. <lb/>However, acetylation of COX-2 shifts the specificity into favoring <lb/>15R-dioxygenation producing 5S,15R-diHETE (146). Additionally, <lb/>COX-2 can oxygenate AA in complex lipids for example; <lb/>arachidonoylethanolamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and <lb/>N-arachidonoyl-glycine (147-149). Recently, 2-AA-lysoPL, and <lb/>ethanolamide derivatives of EPA and DHA were also shown to <lb/>be COX-2 substrates (88, 150). Oxygenation of AA-lysoPL by COX-<lb/>2 generates eicosanoid-lysoPL, which can be hydrolyzed to release <lb/>eicosanoids through intracellular lipases (88). The ability of COX-2 <lb/>to bind and oxygenate a broader range of substrates compared to <lb/>COX-1 has been attributed to a larger active site, the orientation of <lb/>an Arg residue in the substrate binding pocket and amino acid <lb/>residues lining the tunnel leading to the cyclooxygenase active <lb/>site (13). <lb/>COX isoforms exhibit differences in expression, tissue <lb/>distribution, allosteric regulation, and substrate specificity. <lb/>However, some aspects of COX biochemistry are unclear. For <lb/>example, the physiological functions of COX-2-derived <lb/>oxygenated endocannabinoids are unclear. Additionally, COX-<lb/>2 oxygenates AA-lysoPLs into eicosanoid-lysoPLs, which are <lb/>proposed to function in signaling and as precursors to other <lb/>mediators (88). However, the metabolism of eicosanoid-lysoPLs <lb/>requires further investigation. <lb/>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) <lb/>Human CYPs: Nomenclature and Tissue Distribution <lb/>Cytochrome P450s (CYP) are a superfamily of heme-containing <lb/>monooxygenases that are ubiquitous across all domains of life. <lb/>There are 57 functional CYP genes in humans, and their products <lb/>are further divided into 18 families and 41 sub-families based on <lb/>amino acid sequence (151, 152). A robust, unified nomenclature <lb/>system has been devised for CYPs, encompassing all known CYPs <lb/>across living organisms (153, 154). The name includes the root <lb/>&quot;CYP&quot;, followed by a number for family, a letter for subfamily, and <lb/>a gene-identifying number for isoforms. Additionally, an asterisk <lb/>and a number are added at the end to denote alleles (155). Families <lb/>and subfamilies are based on 40% and 55% amino acid sequence <lb/>identity, respectively. <lb/>CYPs are widely distributed in mammalian tissues (156-158), <lb/>with a particularly high expression in the liver, brain, kidney and <lb/>lung. Intracellularly, mammalian CYPs are generally bound to <lb/>mitochondrial membranes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; <lb/>microsomes when in vitro) (159, 160). There is also evidence of <lb/>mammalian CYPs in other compartments including the plasma <lb/>membrane and the nucleus, based on in vitro studies on cultured <lb/>cells (161-164). Some microsomal CYPs are also targeted into <lb/>the mitochondria (159). In the human genome, 50 out of the 57 <lb/>functional CYP genes code for microsomal CYPs, and the <lb/>remaining seven for mitochondrial isoforms. Some CYPs are <lb/>inducible by environmental stimuli, whereas others are <lb/>constitutively expressed (152). Induction of CYP expression by <lb/>environmental compounds can be through interactions with <lb/>nuclear receptors, transcriptional regulatory elements, or non-<lb/>coding RNAs (165). <lb/>Two major functions of CYPs are in drug metabolism and <lb/>lipid metabolism. Here, we focus on lipid metabolism which <lb/>involves members of most human CYP families. For an extensive <lb/>review, the reader is referred to Nelson and Nebert (166). <lb/>Structure of Mammalian CYPs <lb/>Structural characterization was first carried out on bacterial <lb/>CYPs, which are typically water soluble. On the other hand, <lb/>mammalian CYPs are membrane-bound, and initial attempts to <lb/>crystallize them were unsuccessful until a small N-terminal <lb/>hydrophobic helical segment was replaced with a hydrophilic <lb/>sequence from a related protein.

			<body>published was of rabbit CYP2C5, a microsomal CYP isoform <lb/>that hydroxylates progesterone (167). Comparison of CYP2C5 <lb/>structure with closely related microbial CYPs showed a similar <lb/>folding geometry, but unique features of the mammalian enzyme <lb/>were observed such as a hydrophobic surface that was proposed <lb/>to play a role in membrane binding (167). <lb/>CYPs consist of two domains: a b-sheet-rich N-terminal <lb/>domain and a larger helix-rich C-terminal catalytic domain. <lb/>The N-terminal domain in microsomal CYPs contains a <lb/>transmembrane helix that plays a role in membrane anchoring, <lb/>but that role is not exclusive as CYPs contain other regions (in <lb/>the catalytic domain) that bind the membrane. This <lb/>transmembrane helix is not present in mitochondrial CYPs, <lb/>and their membrane binding is facilitated by hydrophobic and <lb/>amphipathic regions on the surface (160, 168). The N-terminus <lb/>also contains a signal peptide sequence for trafficking into the <lb/>appropriate compartment, that in the case of mitochondrial <lb/>CYPs, is cleaved during transport. The catalytic domain <lb/>contains a deep cavity that houses the heme prosthetic group. <lb/>A thiolate ion in a conserved cysteine residue occupies the fifth <lb/>coordination position of heme, and a water molecule occupies <lb/>the sixth position in the resting state. There is variable flexibility <lb/>in the active site among CYPs, and a high degree of flexibility has <lb/>been correlated to substrate promiscuity (169, 170). Residues in <lb/>helices surrounding the active site heme position the substrate <lb/>for catalysis. Additionally, in the CYP4 family, a covalent linkage <lb/>has been identified between the heme group and a conserved <lb/>glutamic acid residue (171), and this interaction plays a role in <lb/>substrate positioning for w-hydroxylation (hydroxylation at the <lb/>methyl end of FAs) (172). <lb/>Other structural features of CYPs include access channels that <lb/>allow entry of substrates from both the aqueous and membrane <lb/>compartments and an exit channel for the product (160). <lb/>Furthermore, oligomerization is well-documented in both <lb/>microsomal and mitochondrial CYPs, which can be between <lb/>subunits of the same CYP (homomeric; e.g., CYP2C2) or <lb/>different CYPs (heteromeric; e.g., CYP2E1/CYP3A4 and <lb/>CYP1A2/CYP2B4) (173-180). These interactions provide an <lb/>additional layer of regulation and play a role in substrate specificity. <lb/>Enzymology of Mammalian CYPs <lb/>CYPs catalyze a wide range of reactions (181, 182), but the most <lb/>common include C-hydroxylation, heteroatom oxidation, <lb/>heteroatom dealkylation, epoxidation, and group migration <lb/>(182). Many reactions of CYPs are dependent on their ability <lb/>(owing to the thiolate-heme group) to catalyze the scission of <lb/>dioxygen and incorporate one of the oxygen atoms into the <lb/>substrate, with the other being reduced to water. These reactions <lb/>require electron transfer from a donor, NADPH, to the heme iron. <lb/>However, transfer of electrons from NADPH to CYPs requires <lb/>protein partners: NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase in the case <lb/>of microsomal CYPs, and the combined functions of adrenodoxin <lb/>reductase and adrenodoxin in mitochondrial CYPs. Thus, CYPs <lb/>form complexes with their redox partners, at least during catalysis. <lb/>That said, not all CYP reactions require external oxygen or <lb/>electron donors. Examples are isomerization reactions catalyzed <lb/>by CYP5A1 (thromboxane synthase) and CYP8A1 (prostacyclin <lb/>synthase) (183), two enzymes involved in PGH 2 metabolism. <lb/>A generalized reaction mechanism for CYPs (Figure 3A) <lb/>contains the following steps: starting with the resting state, <lb/>substrate recruitment displaces H 2 O from the 6 th (axial) <lb/>position of the heme Fe(III). This is followed by a 1-electron <lb/>reduction from a donor forming Fe(II), O 2 binding, and another <lb/>1-electron reduction resulting in a negatively charged peroxo <lb/>group. Protonation of this complex twice by nearby H 2 O or <lb/>amino acid residues results in the scission of the dioxygen (O-O <lb/>bond) into an oxoferryl intermediate (compound I) and a water <lb/>molecule (184). Compound I is thought to be the direct oxidant <lb/>in many CYP oxidation reactions (185). In hydroxylation <lb/>reactions, compound I abstracts a hydrogen from an alkyl <lb/>group in the substrate generating a carbon radical and an iron <lb/>oxygen complex, which rapidly react together forming a <lb/>hydroxyl group on the substrate and regenerating the heme <lb/>iron into the Fe(III) state (Figure 3B). Although this is a <lb/>generalized reaction scheme for CYPs, the intermediates <lb/>following O 2 binding until compound I have been difficult to <lb/>characterize due to their instability and the exact electronic <lb/>structures are not fully assigned (185). <lb/>Mammalian CYPs Play Crucial Roles in Oxidative <lb/>Lipid Metabolism <lb/>CYPs are involved in the metabolism of a wide range of lipids <lb/>including PUFAs and sterols (Table 2). Hydroxylation and <lb/>epoxidation are two common CYP-mediated reactions for PUFA <lb/>substrates. CYPs can hydroxylate FAs terminally (w-<lb/>hydroxylation) or midchain. Similarly, CYP-mediated <lb/>epoxidation can occur on various double bonds in PUFA. CYPs <lb/>exhibit variable preference with respect to the reaction type and <lb/>positional specificity. CYP1-3 families catalyze epoxidation and <lb/>hydroxylation reactions for FAs, whereas the CYP4 family favors <lb/>hydroxylation over epoxidation, specifically w-hydroxylation (204). <lb/>Terminal hydroxylation of AA by CYPs produces 20-<lb/>hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), which functions in <lb/>blood pressure regulation and water balance (205). <lb/>Additionally, terminal hydroxylation functions in w-oxidation <lb/>(a catabolic pathway for FAs), the degradation of some <lb/>eicosanoids (206, 207), and the proper formation of the skin <lb/>permeability barrier (208). Midchain hydroxylation of PUFA <lb/>produces mono-hydroxylated derivatives (HETEs in the case of <lb/>AA) with various bioactivities (reviewed in (152)). Unlike LOXs <lb/>and COXs which oxygenate carbons two bonds away from bis-<lb/>allylic methylene carbons, CYPs can also oxygenate bis-allylic <lb/>carbons (producing 7-, 10-and 13-HETE from AA), and various <lb/>other positions (209-211). However, bis-allylic hydroxylation <lb/>products are unstable in mildly acidic conditions and rearrange <lb/>into conjugated dienes (211). <lb/>Epoxidation of AA by CYPs produce epoxy-eicosatrienoic <lb/>acids (EET). However, other PUFA like LA, EPA and DHA also <lb/>undergo CYP-mediated epoxidation. Epoxy derivatives of <lb/>PUFAs are implicated in blood pressure regulation and <lb/>inflammation (15). Their metabolism is undertaken by several <lb/>epoxide hydrolases including soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) <lb/></body>

			<body>and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) (212). The action of <lb/>epoxide hydrolases produces dihydroxy derivatives which <lb/>possess different bioactivities from their epoxide precursors (15). <lb/>Arachidonoylethanolamide also undergoes CYP hydroxylation <lb/>and epoxidation (213, 214). Similarly, CYPs catalyze epoxidation of <lb/>EPA and DHA ethanolamides, producing compounds with anti-<lb/>inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects (215). These lipids can be <lb/>degraded by both sEH and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) <lb/>(215), suggesting a link between the CYP epoxygenase and <lb/>endocannabinoid pathways. The metabolism and biological roles <lb/>of these mediators is an active area of research (216). <lb/>CYPs catalyze several types of reactions in the metabolism of <lb/>sterols, some of which involve multiple oxygenation/ <lb/>hydroxylation steps. Demethylation of lanosterol by CYP51A1 <lb/>is a key reaction in cholesterol biosynthesis and involves three <lb/>successive oxidations of a methyl group, resulting in its release as <lb/>formic acid and the introduction of a double bond at the D ring <lb/>(217). Similarly, the formation of estradiol from testosterone via <lb/>the action of CYP19A1 (P450arom) involves the elimination of a <lb/>methyl group by three successive oxidation steps and the <lb/>introduction of a double bond at the A ring. Additionally, <lb/>cholesterol side-chain cleavage by CYP11A1 (P450scc) involves <lb/>two hydroxylation steps on different carbons followed by a C-C <lb/>bond cleavage (218). This reaction produces pregnenolone which <lb/>is a key intermediate in the formation of androgens, estrogens, <lb/>glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. <lb/>CYP-mediated hydroxylation reactions are ubiquitous in <lb/>cholesterol metabolism, leading to the formation of oxysterols, <lb/>steroid hormones and bile acids. Key enzymes in the bile acid <lb/>biosynthesis pathways are CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase), <lb/>CYP8B1 (sterol 12a-hydroxylase), CYP27A1 (commonly named <lb/>sterol 27-hydroxylase, but more correctly sterol (25R)26-<lb/>hydroxylase) and CYP7B1 (oxysterol 7a-hydroxylase) (219, 220). <lb/>Of these enzymes, CYP27A1 can both hydroxylate and carboxylate <lb/>the terminal carbon of the sterol side-chain (221). Other enzymes <lb/>involved in quantitatively minor bile acid biosynthesis pathways <lb/>are CYP46A1 (cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase) which 24S-<lb/>hydroxylates cholesterol (222, 223) and CYP3A4 which has 4b-<lb/>and 25-hydroxylase activity (189, 224). CYP enzymes involved in <lb/>steroid hormone biosynthesis include CYP11A (P450scc) (225), <lb/>CYP17A1 (steroid 17a-hydroxylase) (226), CYP21A2 (steroid 21-<lb/>hydroxylase), CYP11B1 (steroid 11b-hydroxylase), and 11B2 <lb/>(aldosterone synthase) and CYP19A1 (aromatase) (198). <lb/>Thus, CYPs play indispensable roles in the metabolism of <lb/>both PUFA and cholesterol. However, some human CYPs like <lb/>CYP2A7 and CYP20A1 have no assigned functions and remain <lb/>orphan enzymes. <lb/>Human Aldo-Keto Reductases (AKRs) and <lb/>Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (HSDs) <lb/>AKRs: Nomenclature, Genes, and Tissue Distribution <lb/>Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) are a superfamily of NADPH-<lb/>dependent oxidoreductases. They catalyze the reduction of <lb/>carbonyl groups to alcohols. A nomenclature system has been <lb/>proposed for AKRs (227). Like CYPs, AKRs are grouped into <lb/>families and subfamilies based on amino acid sequence. Families <lb/>have 40% sequence identity, whereas subfamilies are defined by <lb/>60% sequence similarity.

			<body>&quot;AKR&quot; followed by a number for family, a letter for subfamily <lb/>and finally a number as a unique gene identifier. The <lb/>nomenclature has also been expanded to accommodate <lb/>multimers (228). The older (trivial) names of AKRs are still <lb/>heavily in use, which could lead to confusion. Thus, it is advised <lb/>to follow the nomenclature system proposed by Jez et al. (227). <lb/>There are 15 AKRs in the human genome spanning three families <lb/>and seven subfamilies. Human AKRs have variable expression and <lb/>accept a wide range of substrates (Table 3). They are involved in the <lb/>metabolism of sugars, prostaglandins and sterols, as well as the <lb/>detoxification of carbonyl compounds like lipid peroxidation <lb/>products. Additionally, members of family 6 (AKR6A3, AKR6A5, <lb/>and AKR6A9) are constituents of voltage-gated potassium channels <lb/>(250). All human AKRs have either established or proposed roles in <lb/>lipid metabolism except for AKR1E2. <lb/>Human AKRs are generally cytosolic with some exceptions. <lb/>AKR1B15 is found in mitochondria (236). Members of the <lb/>AKR1C subfamily in the lung (1C1, 1C2 and 1C3) are also <lb/>secreted in pulmonary surfactant (256). AKR1B10 is present in <lb/>lysosomes and is secreted into the intestinal lumen by epithelial <lb/>cells (257). AKR6 members form a complex with a plasma <lb/>membrane voltage channel on the cytosolic side. Finally, rat <lb/>AKR7A2 associates with the Golgi apparatus (258). Human <lb/>AKR7A2 contains a similar N-terminal amphipathic sequence <lb/>and likely associates with the Golgi apparatus. <lb/>Mammalian AKRs: Structure and Enzymology <lb/>Crystal structures have been solved for many mammalian AKRs. <lb/>They comprise of a triosephosphate isomerase barrel motif (a/b) <lb/>8 which has alternating a-helices and b-strands repeating eight <lb/>times. The a-helices surround an internal b-barrel formed by the <lb/>b-strands. The active site is located at the base of the barrel, in <lb/>which the substrate and the nicotinamide head group of NADPH <lb/>(cofactor) are proximally positioned for the reaction, while three <lb/>flexible loops form the back of the barrel and control substrate <lb/>specificity (259, 260). The structure also contains two additional <lb/>helices that are not part of the barrel motif. Family 1 AKRs are <lb/>monomeric, whereas families 6 and 7 form tetramers and dimers, <lb/>respectively (258, 261). <lb/>AKRs catalyze the stereospecific reduction of carbonyls into <lb/>alcohols. They can also catalyze the reverse oxidation reaction. <lb/>However, the reducing direction is generally favored due to the <lb/>abundance of reduced cofactor in the cellular environment. AKRs <lb/>can use both NADPH and NADH, but NADPH is the preferred <lb/>cofactor for most known AKRs as they interact with the <lb/>phosphoryl group present in NADPH but not NADH (262, 263). <lb/>The stereospecific nature of the reaction is due to the orientation of <lb/>the NADPH and the substrate in the active site. The NADPH is <lb/>bound in the anti-conformation (with respect to the ribose ring) <lb/>which promotes the transfer of the 4-pro-R hydride (264), and the <lb/>substrate is positioned perpendicular to the cofactor. <lb/>The reaction of AKRs follows an ordered bi-bi mechanism in <lb/>which the NADPH cofactor binds first and leaves last. The active <lb/>site of AKRs contains a highly conserved catalytic tetrad of Tyr, <lb/>Lys, Asp and His. The hydride transfer is facilitated by acid-base <lb/>catalysis involving the protonation state of Tyr and the other <lb/>catalytic residues. In the reduction direction, the protonated <lb/>form of Tyr acts as an acid by participating in proton relay <lb/>TABLE 3 | Human AKRs: Genes, expression sites, and example substrates. <lb/>Gene <lb/>Alternative protein name <lb/>Expression sites <lb/>Example substrates <lb/>Refs. <lb/>AKR1A1 Aldehyde reductase <lb/>Brain, kidney, liver, small <lb/>intestine <lb/>4-HNE, acrolein, succinic semi-aldehyde, D-glucuronic <lb/>acid, phospholipid aldehydes <lb/>(229, 230), <lb/>AKR1B1 Aldose reductase/Prostaglandin F <lb/>synthase <lb/>Ubiquitous <lb/>Glucose, 4-HNE &amp; its glutathione conjugate, acrolein, <lb/>PGH 2 , phospholipid aldehydes <lb/>(229, 230), <lb/>AKR1B10 Small intestine aldose reductase <lb/>Small intestine, colon, liver, <lb/>cornea <lb/>Farnesal, retinoids, acrolein, phospholipid aldehydes <lb/>(229, 231-235), <lb/>AKR1B15 Aldo-keto reductase/3-Keto-acyl CoA <lb/>reductase <lb/>Placenta, testis, adipose tissue <lb/>Androgens, estrogens, <lb/>3-keto-acyl CoA conjugates <lb/>(236) <lb/>AKR1C1 20a-HSD <lb/>Kidney, lung, liver, testis, brain <lb/>Progesterone, estrone, 5a-dihydrotestosterone, 4-HNE <lb/>(230, 237-239), <lb/>AKR1C2 Type 3 3a-HSD <lb/>Liver, brain, lung, prostate <lb/>Progesterone, estrone, 5a-dihydrotestosterone <lb/>(237, 238), <lb/>AKR1C3 Type 5 17b-HSD/Prostaglandin F <lb/>synthase <lb/>Liver, lung, prostate, brain, <lb/>breast, lymphocytes <lb/>Progesterone, estrone, 5a-dihydrotestosterone, PGH 2 , <lb/>PGD 2 , 4-HNE <lb/>(238, 240-242), <lb/>AKR1C4 Type 1 3a-HSD <lb/>Liver <lb/>3-Keto-5b-sterols, <lb/>5a-dihydrotestosterone <lb/>(230, 238), <lb/>AKR1D1 Steroid 5b-reductase <lb/>Liver, placenta, brain <lb/>D 4 -Ketosteroids, particularly bile acid intermediates <lb/>(237, 243-245), <lb/>AKR1E2 <lb/>1,5-Anhydro-D-fructose reductase <lb/>Liver, testis <lb/>1,5-Anhydro-D-fructose <lb/>(246, 247) <lb/>KCNAB1 Potassium voltage-gated channel b-<lb/>subunit-1 (Kvb1)/AKR6A3 <lb/>Brain, heart <lb/>Lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes (presumed)* <lb/>(248, 249) <lb/>KCNAB2 Potassium voltage-gated channel b-<lb/>subunit-2 (Kvb2)/AKR6A5 <lb/>Brain, spinal cord <lb/>Methylglyoxal, acrolein, 4-ONE, oxPL, PGJ 2 * <lb/>( 250-252) <lb/>KCNAB3 Potassium voltage-gated channel b-<lb/>subunit-3 (Kvb3)/AKR6A9 <lb/>Brain <lb/>No data. <lb/>(253) <lb/>AKR7A2 Aflatoxin aldehyde reductase (AFAR1) <lb/>Ubiquitous <lb/>Aflatoxin B1, succinic semi-aldehyde, 4-HNE <lb/>(230, 254) <lb/>AKR7A3 Aflatoxin aldehyde reductase (AFAR2) <lb/>Liver, stomach, pancreas, <lb/>kidney <lb/>Aflatoxin B1 <lb/>(255), <lb/>*Evidence from work on the rat ortholog. 4-HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; 4-ONE, 4-oxo-2-nonenal; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; oxPL, oxidized phospholipid; PG, prostaglandin <lb/>(e.g., PGH 2 , PGD 2 , PGJ 2 ). <lb/></body>

			<body>with His (259) (Figure 4A). This polarizes the carbonyl group of <lb/>the substrate, allowing it to accept a hydride ion from the <lb/>cofactor. In the oxidation direction, the phenolate form of Tyr <lb/>(generated through proton relay with Lys and Asp) acts as a base <lb/>and abstracts a proton from the alcohol group of the substrate, <lb/>facilitating hydride transfer to the cofactor (259) (Figure 4B). <lb/>AKR1D subfamily members catalyze the irreversible 5b-<lb/>reduction of sterol double bonds into single bonds, instead of <lb/>the reversible reduction of carbonyls typical of AKRs (Figure <lb/>4C). They possess an altered catalytic tetrad with Glu replacing <lb/>His (265). This substitution allows the substrate to penetrate <lb/>deeper into the active site pocket, positioning C5 close to the 4-<lb/>pro-H of NADPH (259). The catalytic Glu residue is thought to <lb/>act as a superacid, facilitating the enolization of the steroid <lb/>double bond and allowing hydride transfer to C5 (259, 265). <lb/>Human AKR1B1 catalyzes the isomerization of PGH 2 to <lb/>PGD 2 in the absence of cofactor, as well as the reduction of <lb/>PGH 2 to PGF 2a in the presence of cofactor (266). Curiously, both <lb/>of these reactions are reported to be facilitated by a catalytic triad <lb/>of Lys, His and Asp, without the involvement of Tyr in catalysis, <lb/>although Tyr is still required for the p-nitrobenzaldehyde <lb/>reductase activity of the enzyme (266). Thus, both Tyr and His <lb/>can participate in acid-base catalysis, at least in AKR1B1. <lb/>Involvement of Human AKRs in Lipid Metabolism <lb/>Human AKRs play roles in the detoxification of reactive <lb/>carbonyls. Several AKRs metabolize lipid peroxidation-derived <lb/>aldehydes like acrolein and 4-HNE (Table 3). Additionally, some <lb/>AKRs (1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 6A5) can reduce oxidized phospholipids, <lb/>particularly phospholipid aldehydes (229, 251). These activities <lb/>mitigate the cytotoxicity of reactive carbonyls (240, 267-269), <lb/>and in the case of family 6 AKRs are also thought to function in <lb/>redox sensing (251). <lb/>Both AKR1B1 and AKR1C3 exhibit prostaglandin F synthase <lb/>activity (270, 271). AKR1B1 catalyzes the reduction of PGH 2 to <lb/>PGF 2a . AKR1C3 catalyzes the same reaction as well as the <lb/>A <lb/>B <lb/>C <lb/>FIGURE 4 | Catalytic mechanism of aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) in the: (A) Reduction direction and (B) Oxidation direction.

			<body>reversible reduction of PGD 2 to 9a,11b-PGF 2 (241). <lb/>Furthermore, AKR1B1 catalyzes the isomerization of PGH 2 to <lb/>PGD 2 exclusively in the absence of NADPH as noted previously. <lb/>However, the biological relevance of this activity is not clear as <lb/>this isomerization reaction is also catalyzed by two prostaglandin <lb/>D synthases (272), and the cellular redox status favors the <lb/>reduction reaction. Both PGF 2a and its isomer 9a,11b-PGF 2 <lb/>promote uterine contractions during labor (237). <lb/>Six of the 15 human AKRs are involved in sterol/steroid <lb/>metabolism: AKR1B15, the four members of the AKR1C <lb/>subfamily (also grouped as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases; <lb/>HSDs), and AKR1D1. AKR1B15 catalyzes the 17b-reduction of <lb/>androgens and estrogens (236). AKR1C1 (20a-HSD) catalyzes the <lb/>20a-reduction of progesterone inactivating it (273), whereas <lb/>AKR1C2 (Type 3 3a-HSD) possesses a 3a-dehydrogenase activity <lb/>and deactivates 5a-dihydrotesterone (259). AKR1C3 (Type 5 17b-<lb/>HSD) exhibits 17-ketoreductase activity and produces testosterone <lb/>and estradiol from their respective precursors. <lb/>AKR1D1 and AKR1C4 (Type 1 3a-HSD) catalyze key steps <lb/>in bile acid biosynthesis. AKR1D1 catalyzes irreversible 5b-<lb/>reduction of a double bond in 3-ketosterols. This modification <lb/>changes the geometry of the steroid nucleus from flat to twisted, <lb/>with a bend in the A/B ring junction. Next, AKR1C4 catalyzes <lb/>the 3a-reduction of the ketosteroid, resulting in a 3a,5b-<lb/>configuration, a characteristic feature of bile acids. <lb/>Other HSDs Belong to the Short-Chain <lb/>Dehydrogenase/Reductase (SDR) Family <lb/>Some HSDs belong to a different family of enzymes: the short-<lb/>chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR). SDRs exhibit key <lb/>differences from AKRs in structure, kinetics, catalytic <lb/>mechanism, and reaction stereochemistry (reviewed in (274)). <lb/>Of note, HSDs of the SDR family work as either ketosteroid <lb/>reductases or hydroxysteroid oxidases, depending on their <lb/>preference for the corresponding forms of NADP(H) or NAD <lb/>(H). This contrasts with HSDs of the AKR1C family which <lb/>operate in the reduction direction using (primarily) NADPH <lb/>(274). Like CYPs and AKRs, a systematic nomenclature has been <lb/>proposed for SDRs (275). However, the old names (especially for <lb/>HSDs) remain heavily in use. HSDs of the SDR family have <lb/>important functions in sterol/steroid metabolism (Table 4). <lb/>BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAYS OF OXIDIZED <lb/>LIPIDS <lb/>Oxygenated PUFA and Oxidized <lb/>Phospholipids <lb/>Classification of Oxygenated PUFA as Eicosanoids <lb/>and Docosanoids <lb/>The term &quot;oxylipin&quot; refers to oxygenated PUFA derivatives. It <lb/>encompasses a wide range of oxidized lipids like hydroxy-, <lb/>epoxy-, oxo-FAs, and endoperoxides. Oxylipins can be <lb/>classified according to their precursor into eicosanoids (C20) <lb/>or docosanoids (C22), etc., and this system will be used from here <lb/>on. Following the classification system of the LIPID MAPS <lb/>consortium, eicosanoids include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, <lb/>thromboxanes, lipoxins, hepoxilins, E-resolvins, as well as <lb/>hydroxy-, hydroperoxy-, epoxy-, and oxo-eicosanoids (286). <lb/>Likewise, docosanoids include D-resolvins, protectins, maresins, <lb/>hydroxy-, hydroperoxy-, epoxy-, and oxo-docosanoids. Structures <lb/>of these lipids are available on the LIPID MAPS database (287). <lb/>Here, we focus on the biosynthesis of eicosanoids derived <lb/>from AA and EPA, and docosanoids derived from DHA, as they <lb/>are the most studied. Due to the broad substrate specificity of <lb/>enzymes involved in lipid oxidation, PUFAs with shorter chains <lb/>or different number of double bonds also undergo similar <lb/>reactions. Similarly, oxygenation of endocannabinoids occurs <lb/>on the PUFA moiety and follows the enzymatic mechanisms <lb/>described here. Further aspects of oxygenated endocannabinoids <lb/>are discussed in other reviews (216, 288). <lb/>Release of PUFA from Membranes for Oxylipin <lb/>Biosynthesis <lb/>Intracellular concentration of free PUFA is tightly regulated <lb/>through conjugation with coenzyme A (CoA) and subsequent <lb/>esterification into lysoPL forming PL or shuttling into other <lb/>pathways (like b-oxidation). PUFAs are abundant in membrane <lb/>PLs, typically esterified at the sn-2 position. The classical pathway of <lb/>oxylipin biosynthesis involves the release of PUFA from membrane <lb/>PL via the action of lipases like phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), <lb/>phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase (289, 290). PLA 2 <lb/>enzymes are classified into six types: secreted (sPLA 2 ), cytosolic <lb/>(cPLA 2 ), calcium-independent (iPLA 2 ), platelet-activating factor <lb/>TABLE 4 | Human SDR-HSDs and their substrates/reactions. <lb/>Gene <lb/>Alternative protein names <lb/>Substrates <lb/>Reaction <lb/>Refs. <lb/>HSD3B1 Type 1 3b-HSD/D 5-4 isomerase/SDR11E1 <lb/>3b-Hydroxy-D 5 -sterols <lb/>Oxidation &amp; isomerization <lb/>(276, 277), <lb/>HSD3B2 Type 2 3b-HSD/D 5-4 isomerase/SDR11E2 <lb/>3b-Hydroxy-D 5 -sterols <lb/>Oxidation &amp; isomerization <lb/>(277, 278), <lb/>HSD3B7 Type 7 3b-HSD/SDR11E3 <lb/>3b-Hydroxy-D 5 -sterols <lb/>Oxidation &amp; isomerization <lb/>(279) <lb/>HSD11B1 Type 1 11b-HSD/Corticosteroid 11b-dehydrogenase <lb/>isozyme 1/SDR26C1 <lb/>11b-Hydroxysterols (e.g. cortisol), <lb/>Oxidation <lb/>(280) <lb/>HSD11B2 Type 2 11b-HSD/Corticosteroid 11b-dehydrogenase <lb/>isozyme 2/SDR9C3 <lb/>11b-Hydroxysterols (e.g. cortisol), <lb/>Oxidation <lb/>(280) <lb/>HSD17B1 Type 1 17b-HSD/Estradiol 17b-dehydrogenase 1/ <lb/>SDR28C1 <lb/>Estrogens and androgens <lb/>Reduction <lb/>(281, 282) <lb/>HSD17B4 Type 4 17b-HSD/Peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme type <lb/>2/SDR8C1 <lb/>(24R,25R)-3a,7a,12a,24-Tetrahydroxy-5b-<lb/>cholestan-26-oyl-CoA <lb/>Reduction <lb/>(283) <lb/>HSD17B7 Type 7 17b-HSD/3-Ketosteroid reductase/SDR37C1 <lb/>3b-Hydroxysterols, 17b-estradiol <lb/>Reduction <lb/>(284, 285) <lb/></body>

			<body>acetylhydrolases (PAH-AH), lysosomal (LPLA 2 ), and adipose <lb/>(AdPLA), and these are further divided into groups and <lb/>subgroups (291, 292). cPLA 2 a is localized in the cytosol but <lb/>translocates to intracellular membranes upon calcium activation, <lb/>and exhibits selectivity for phospholipids containing AA at the sn-2 <lb/>position (293, 294). On the other hand, the release of DHA from the <lb/>membrane can be facilitated by iPLA 2 b (295, 296). Last, sPLA 2 <lb/>enzymes are involved in the release of AA, EPA and DHA (297, <lb/>298). PLA 2 enzymes are extensively reviewed by Murakami (299). <lb/>Biosynthesis of Eicosanoids <lb/>Arachidonic acid is a substrate of eicosanoids produced through <lb/>the actions of COXs, LOXs, CYPs, and other downstream <lb/>enzymes (Figure 5A).

			<body>various enzymes. However, for many of these, their specific <lb/>biosynthetic pathways, enantiomeric composition and <lb/>biological actions in tissues are not well understood and the <lb/>levels formed are extremely low in comparison to classic PGs and <lb/>monohydroxy-oxylipins. Furthermore, their bioactions often <lb/>require amounts of lipids that are considerably higher than <lb/>levels detected in cell and tissue samples, and thus could be <lb/>considered pharmacological. <lb/>COXs convert AA into PGG 2 which is reduced into PGH 2 <lb/>(Figure 5A). From there, PGH 2 functions as substrate for classic <lb/>PGs and thromboxane, generated by tissue-specific enzymes. <lb/>CYP5A1 (thromboxane synthase) is expressed in several cell <lb/>types and tissues (platelets, macrophages, lung, kidney, liver) and <lb/>catalyzes the isomerization of PGH 2 into thromboxane A 2 , a <lb/>potent vasoconstrictor and activator of platelet aggregation (300, <lb/>301). CYP5A1 also catalyzes the cleavage PGH 2 into <lb/>malondialdehyde and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid. <lb/>CYP8A1 (prostacyclin synthase) is widely expressed (abundant <lb/>in ovary, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and prostate) and catalyzes <lb/>the isomerization of PGH 2 into prostacyclin (PGI 2 ), a vasodilator <lb/>and inhibitor of platelet aggregation (302). <lb/>PGH 2 can also be converted into PGD 2 through the action of <lb/>AKR1B1 or PGD synthases, of which there are two isoforms: <lb/>lipocalin-type PGD synthase (in the central nervous system, male <lb/>genitalia, heart, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma) and <lb/>hematopoietic PGD synthase (in antigen-presenting cells, mast <lb/>cells and megakaryocytes) (266, 303). PGD 2 plays roles in the <lb/>regulation of body temperature, sleep cycle, pain perception and <lb/>the immune response (304). In the uterus, AKR1C3 catalyzes the <lb/>reduction of PGD 2 into 9a,11b-PGF 2 , which promotes uterine <lb/>contractions (237). Similarly, AKR1C3 and AKR1B1 catalyze the <lb/>reduction of PGH 2 into PGF 2 a, which also promotes uterine <lb/>contractions (305). Finally, PGH 2 can be converted into PGE 2 <lb/>via the action of PGE synthases, of which there are three <lb/>isoforms: an inducible microsomal isoform (mPGES-1), a <lb/>constitutive microsomal isoform (mPGES-2) and a constitutive <lb/>cytosolic isoform (cPGES) (306). PGE 2 is abundant in the body <lb/>and plays a complex role in immunity and inflammation (307). <lb/>Additionally, PGE 2 is reduced into PGF2a by prostaglandin 9-<lb/>ketoreductase (PG-9KR) (308). <lb/>COXs also produce 11R-, 15R-, and 15S-HpETEs as side <lb/>products, all three of which can be reduced into their <lb/>corresponding alcohols by peroxidase activity, which are in <lb/>turn reduced into oxo-ETEs by 15-hydroxyprostaglandin <lb/>dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). Bioactivities of HETEs and oxo-<lb/>ETEs are extensively reviewed by Powell and Rokach (309). <lb/>5-LOX converts AA into 5S-HpETE (Figure 5A), which is <lb/>reduced into 5S-HETE through the action of a peroxidase (e.g., <lb/>GPX) or converted into leukotriene A 4 (LTA 4 ) through the <lb/>leukotriene synthase activity of 5-LOX. Various immune cells <lb/>(neutrophils, monocytes, platelets) express 5-hydroxyeicosanoid <lb/>dehydrogenase (5-HEDH) which converts 5S-HETE into 5-oxo-<lb/>HETE, a potent chemoattractant for eosinophils (310). On the <lb/>other hand, LTA 4 serves as a precursor for LT peptide conjugates <lb/>(LTC 4 , D 4 and E 4 ) and lipoxins (A and B). LTC 4 , D 4 , and E 4 are <lb/>synthesized from LTA 4 through LTC 4 synthase (a gluthathione-<lb/>S-transferase), g-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and dipeptidase <lb/>2 (DPEP2). Leukotrienes exhibit pro-inflammatory properties <lb/>and are implicated in asthma and allergic reactions (311). On the <lb/>other hand, lipoxins are thought to be synthesized by 12S-LOX <lb/>through a transcellular pathway which involves interactions <lb/>between two cell types (312). Lipoxins exhibit anti-<lb/>inflammatory properties and are proposed to play a role in <lb/>wound healing and tissue homeostasis (313). Alternatively, <lb/>LTA 4 can be hydrolyzed by leukotriene A 4 hydrolase (LTA4H) <lb/>into LTB 4 , which attracts neutrophils (314). <lb/>15-LOXs converts AA into 15S-HpETE (Figure 5A), which <lb/>can be reduced into 15S-HETE then oxidized into 15-oxo-ETE. <lb/>15S-HpETE and 15S-HETE are also substrates for 5-LOX, which <lb/>produces a 5S,6S epoxy intermediate that can be hydrolyzed into <lb/>lipoxins by unidentified hydrolases. Additionally, 15S-HpETE is <lb/>proposed to be a precursor for eoxin A 4 (a 14,15 leukotriene), <lb/>which is converted into peptide conjugates (eoxin C 4 , D 4 , and E 4 ) <lb/>similar to leukotrienes (315). Conversion of eoxin A 4 into C 4 is <lb/>thought to involve LTC4S. Enzymes that catalyze the following <lb/>two steps leading to eoxin D 4 and E 4 are unidentified, <lb/>presumably a GGT isoform and DPEP2. Eoxins are produced <lb/>in eosinophils, mast cells and airway epithelial cells, and have <lb/>been shown to possess pro-inflammatory properties (316). <lb/>12S-HpETE and 12R-HpETE are produced by 12S-LOX and <lb/>12R-LOX, respectively (Figure 5A). These hydroperoxides can <lb/>be reduced to their corresponding alcohols via a peroxidase, <lb/>and both alcohols further oxidized into 12-oxo-ETE by 12-<lb/>hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase (12-HEDH) (309). Both <lb/>hydroperoxides are also precursors for hepoxilins, which are <lb/>epoxy-alcohols. eLOX3 in skin converts 12R-HpETE into either <lb/>hepoxilin A 3 or 12-oxo-ETE. On the other hand, 12S-HpETE <lb/>can be converted into hepoxilin A 3 or B 3 by either 12S-LOX or <lb/>eLOX3, but eLOX3 also generates 12-oxo-ETE (70, 317). <lb/>Hepoxilins A 3 and B 3 are hydrolyzed by sEH into trioxilins <lb/>A 3 and B 3 , respectively (318). Hepoxilin A 3 can also be <lb/>conjugated with glutathione via LTC4S producing hepoxilin <lb/>A 3 -C, which can be converted into a hepoxilin A 3 -D by GGT <lb/>(319). The occurrence of hepoxilin A 3 -E (cysteinyl conjugate) <lb/>has also been proposed but not confirmed. Hepoxilin A 3 is <lb/>proposed to regulate mucosal inflammation by recruiting <lb/>neutrophils across the epithelial junction into the gut <lb/>lumen (320). <lb/>CYPs generate various midchain R-and S-HETEs as well as 20-<lb/>HETE through hydroxylation of AA (Figure 5A). Alternatively, <lb/>epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) are produced from AA through <lb/>epoxidation of its double bonds. Major mammalian CYP <lb/>epoxygenases include CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2J2 (15). EETs <lb/>are further metabolized by sEH (and potentially other epoxide <lb/>hydrolases) into dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DiHETrE). Note <lb/>that EPA and other PUFA are also targets of CYP-mediated <lb/>reactions, which generate the corresponding hydroxy-, epoxy-, <lb/>and dihydroxy-derivatives. <lb/>&quot;E-resolvins&quot;, another class of eicosanoids, are proposed to be <lb/>generated from EPA (Figure 5B). COX-2 and CYPs have both been <lb/>proposed to act on EPA to produce 18R-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic <lb/>acid (18R-HEPE), which is in turn a proposed precursor for lipids <lb/></body>

			<body>termed resolvins E1, E2 and E3 (E-resolvins). It is known that the <lb/>acetylation of COX-2 shifts its activity into favoring the <lb/>lipoxygenase-type reaction over the cyclooxygenase activity, and <lb/>that acetylated COX-2 generates 18R-HEPE from EPA (321). <lb/>However, acetylated COX-2 is not a physiologically relevant form, <lb/>and 18R-HEPE could be potentially generated through other means. <lb/>COX-2 is theoretically capable of generating 18R-HEPE from EPA <lb/>in a lipoxygenase-type reaction followed by peroxidase activity. <lb/>However, whether the generation of 18R-HEPE from EPA occurs in <lb/>vivo and in sufficient amounts without COX-2 acetylation is <lb/>unknown. Microbial CYPs have also be proposed as sources of <lb/>18R-HEPE during infection. E-resolvins are proposed to be <lb/>produced through a transcellular mechanism involving microbial <lb/>and mammalian cells (322). Alternatively, mammalian CYPs are <lb/>also potential sources of 18R-HEPE, although the exact isoforms <lb/>involved are unknown. <lb/>18R-HEPE can be metabolized by 5-LOX into a 5S-<lb/>hydroperoxy intermediate and further into a 5S,6S-epoxy <lb/>intermediate (323). The former is proposed to be converted <lb/>into resolvin E2 by a peroxidase, whereas the latter is proposed to <lb/>be hydrolyzed into resolvin E1 by LTA4H (324). 18S-analogues <lb/>of resolvin E1 and E2 have also been described and are proposed <lb/>to be generated from 18S-HEPE through a similar pathway <lb/>(Figure 5B), although the enzymatic sources of 18S-HEPE <lb/>(aside from acetylated COX-2) are also unknown. 18R-HEPE <lb/>is also proposed to be a precursor to two stereoisomers <lb/>collectively called resolvin E3 generated by 15-LOX-1 (325). <lb/>E-resolvins are proposed to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and <lb/>promote the resolution of inflammation (325, 326). <lb/>Both lipoxins and E-resolvins have been classified as specialized <lb/>pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), a term which currently describes <lb/>families of oxygenated PUFA metabolites with proposed roles in the <lb/>resolution of inflammation and tissue regeneration generated at <lb/>extremely low levels in biological samples. <lb/>Biosynthesis of Docosanoids <lb/>Oxygenation of DHA by LOXs and CYPs forms oxygenated <lb/>docosanoids (hydroxy-, epoxy-, and dihydroxy derivatives). DHA <lb/>is also the precursor to several classes of multiply oxygenated <lb/>docosanoids, including additional SPMs which have been named <lb/>maresins, D-resolvins, and protectins (Figure 6). Maresin <lb/>biosynthesis has been proposed to start with action of 12S-LOX, <lb/>generating 14S-hydroperoxy-DHA (14S-HpDoHE) then a 13S,14S-<lb/>epoxy intermediate. Hydrolysis of this epoxy intermediate by sEH <lb/>or an unidentified hydrolase is proposed to generate maresin 2 and <lb/>maresin 1, respectively (93, 327). The biosynthesis of protectin and <lb/>D-resolvins both begin with 15-LOX-1 which generates a 17S-<lb/>hydroperoxide (17S-HpDoHE). Further conversion of this <lb/>hydroperoxide into a 16S,17S-epoxy intermediate by 15-LOX-1 <lb/>followed by hydrolysis (unidentified hydrolase) is proposed to <lb/>generate protectin D1 (328). Alternatively, 17S-HpDoHE could be <lb/>reduced into an alcohol by a peroxidase, which then serves as a <lb/>precursor for D-resolvins. In this route, 5-LOX is proposed to <lb/>generate two distinct products hydroperoxides (4S or 7S), which <lb/>FIGURE 6 | Biosynthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) derived from docosahexaenoic acid.

			<body>undergo further transformations leading to several D-resolvins <lb/>(Figure 6). Additionally, epoxide intermediates in the previously <lb/>described pathways are proposed to undergo glutathione <lb/>conjugation by LTC4S, generating peptide conjugates of maresin, <lb/>protectin and D-resolvin named MCTR1, PCTR1, and RCTR1, <lb/>respectively (CTR = conjugate in tissue regeneration). These <lb/>conjugates are proposed to be metabolized by GGT and DPEP2, <lb/>similar to leukotrienes (329). <lb/>Oxygenation of Esterified PUFA and Biosynthesis of <lb/>Oxidized Phospholipids <lb/>The classical pathway for the biosynthesis of oxidized <lb/>phospholipids starts with the release of PUFA from membranes <lb/>through the action of PLA 2 . PUFA are then oxygenated by the <lb/>enzymes discussed earlier. This is followed by acylation of <lb/>oxygenated PUFA with CoA and esterification into a lysoPL via <lb/>the action of an sn-2 acyltransferase. <lb/>The generation of PL-esterified eicosanoids is well-<lb/>documented in mammalian cells such as epithelial, endothelial <lb/>and immune cells (330). HETE-PLs are acutely generated by <lb/>activated neutrophils, platelets and monocytes (331-333). <lb/>Similarly, PGD 2 and PGE 2 generated from COX-1-derived <lb/>PGH 2 in activated platelets are rapidly incorporated into PE-<lb/>lysoPLs (334). Also, EET-PLs have been detected in rat liver <lb/>(335). For most of these, the mechanism of formation requires <lb/>endogenous generation of an oxylipin, which is then rapidly <lb/>esterified into membrane PL pools (e.g., on a timescale of <lb/>minutes) via Lands cycle enzymes (336). <lb/>15-LOXs also contribute to the formation of oxPL by two <lb/>other pathways. The first involves direct oxygenation of <lb/>membrane PLs (331, 337). In the second pathway, 15-LOXs <lb/>oxygenate the PUFA moiety of CEs, then hydrolysis of <lb/>oxygenated PUFA from CE liberates oxygenated PUFA which <lb/>can be esterified to lysoPL (87). <lb/>Recent studies found that COX-2, 15-LOX-2, and platelet <lb/>12S-LOX can catalyze the oxygenation of 2-AA-lysoPL released <lb/>by iPLA 2 g in response to calcium ionophore stimulation (88, 94). <lb/>These reactions generate 2-eicosanoid-lysoPLs which are <lb/>proposed to be a source of free eicosanoids as well as acting as <lb/>signaling mediators themselves. 2-eicosanoid-lysoPLs can also be <lb/>converted into oxPLs through the action of sn-1 acyltransferase <lb/>(338). Cytochrome c has been recently been identified as a <lb/>plasmalogenase, and is proposed to be a source of 2-<lb/>eicosanoid-lysoPLs under conditions of oxidative stress (339). <lb/>These findings describe novel pathways for the biosynthesis of <lb/>oxPLs (Figure 7). Further research is required to assess the <lb/>contribution of these pathways to the formation of oxPLs and <lb/>other mediators in vivo. <lb/>Biosynthesis of Oxysterols, Bile Acids, and <lb/>Steroid Hormones <lb/>Oxysterols <lb/>Oxysterols are formed in the first steps of cholesterol <lb/>metabolism: they are oxidized forms of cholesterol and also of <lb/>its precursors (340). 7a-Hydroxycholesterol (7a-HC) is formed <lb/>from cholesterol by CYP7A1 and represents the first metabolite <lb/>in the neutral pathway of bile acid biosynthesis (Figure 8) (219, <lb/>220). (25R)26-Hydroxycholesterol (26-HC), more commonly <lb/>called 27-hydroxycholesterol, and 3b-hydroxycholest-5-en-<lb/>(25R)26-oic acid (3b-HCA) are both formed from cholesterol <lb/>by CYP27A1 and are the first members of the acidic or <lb/>alternative pathway of bile acid biosynthesis (219-221). While <lb/>CYP7A1 is an endoplasmic reticulum and liver specific protein, <lb/>CYP27A1 is mitochondrial and expressed in many tissues. <lb/>CYP46A1 is almost exclusively expressed in neurons, its <lb/>function is to maintain cholesterol balance in the brain, <lb/>converting cholesterol from a molecule unable to pass the <lb/>blood brain barrier to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), a <lb/>more polar molecule which can cross the barrier (222, 223, <lb/>341). CYP11A1, like CYP27A1, is a mitochondrial inner <lb/>membrane protein. It is highly expressed in steroidogenic <lb/>tissue and will oxidize cholesterol to pregnenolone in a three <lb/>step process involving 22R-hydroxycholesterol (22R-HC) and <lb/>20R,22R-dihydroxycholesterol as intermediates (20R,22R-diHC) <lb/>(342, 343) (Figure 9). The pathways of bile acid biosynthesis are <lb/>discussed in more detail below. <lb/>While most &quot;primary&quot; oxysterols are formed from cholesterol <lb/>in CYP catalyzed reactions, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase <lb/>(CH25H), the dominating enzyme that generates 25-<lb/>hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is an exception, in that is not a <lb/>CYP, but a member of a family of enzymes that utilize di-iron <lb/>cofactors to catalyze the hydroxylation (344). CH25H is <lb/>expressed in activated immune cells and 25-HC has both anti-<lb/>bacterial and anti-viral activities (345-348). 25-HC is <lb/>metabolized by CYP7B1 to 7a,25-diHC, a ligand to the GPCR <lb/>Epstein Barr virus induced gene 2 (EBI2 or GPR183). 7a,25-<lb/>diHC acts as a chemoattractant to GPR183 expressing immune <lb/>cells (349, 350). An alternative route to 7a,25-diHC production <lb/>is through CYP3A4 oxidation of 7a-HC (190), while the same <lb/>enzyme has also been reported to act as a second cholesterol 25-<lb/>hydroxylase and also a 4b-hydroxylase of cholesterol (189, 351). <lb/>Oxysterols can also be formed from cholesterol precursors in <lb/>reactions catalyzed by CYP enzymes (202, 352). These reactions <lb/>may be important in patients suffering from inborn errors of <lb/>cholesterol biosynthesis such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome <lb/>(SLOS, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase deficiency) and <lb/>desmosterolosis (3b-hydroxysterol-D 24 -reductase deficiency) or <lb/>where there is very high expression of sterol hydroxylases, e.g., <lb/>CYP7A1 in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, where CYP27A1 <lb/>is deficient. <lb/>Bile Acid Biosynthesis <lb/>There are two quantitatively major and at least five minor <lb/>pathways of bile acid biosynthesis and all pathways involve <lb/>multiple oxidation reactions (219, 220, 353-358). Besides CYP <lb/>enzymes, key oxidation reactions are carried out by <lb/>hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) members of the short <lb/>chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family and reductions <lb/>by aldo-keto reductases (AKR) enzymes. One of the minor <lb/>pathways that results in the formation of 3b,5a,6b-<lb/>trihydroxycholan-24-oic acid involves of cholestane-3b,5a,6b-<lb/>triol which is likely formed via the cholesterol peroxidation <lb/>product 5,6-epoxycholesterol (219, 354). <lb/></body>

			<body>While the acidic pathway may be most important in infants <lb/>(359), at later stages of life the neutral pathway is dominant. This is <lb/>initiated by CYP7A1 oxidation of cholesterol to generate 7a-HC in <lb/>the liver. Further oxidation may occur at C-12 by CYP8B1 to <lb/>generate 7a,12a-dihydroxycholesterol (7a,12a-diHC), which may <lb/>be preceded or succeeded by oxidation and isomerization of the 3b-<lb/>hydroxy-5-ene structure to a 3-oxo-4-ene by HSD3B7, giving 7a-<lb/>hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one (7a-HCO) and 7a,12a-<lb/>dihydroxycholest-4-en-3-one (7a,12a-diHCO), respectively <lb/>(Figure 8). A general feature of bile acid biosynthesis is that many <lb/>of the enzymes involved in the pathways accept multiple substrates <lb/>resulting in variations in the order of reactions depending on the <lb/>tissue in which they proceed (360). The next steps involve A-ring <lb/>reductions which may be succeeded or preceded by (25R)26-<lb/>hydroxylation and (25R)26-carboxylation to ultimately give <lb/>3a,7a,12a-trihydroxy-5b-cholanestan-(25R)26-oic acid. The A-<lb/>ring reductions are carried out by AKR1D1 and AKR1C4, while <lb/>CYP27A1 carries out the (25R)26-oxidations. Side-chain <lb/>shortening of the cholestanoic acid proceeds in the peroxisome <lb/>through the CoA-thioester formed by bile acid Co-A synthetase <lb/>(BACS, SLC27A5) or very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLCS, <lb/>SLC27A2). Following C-25 racemization by a-methylacyl-CoA <lb/>racemase (AMACR) the next oxidation involves the introduction <lb/>of D 24 double bond by the enzyme acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). <lb/>The D 24 double bond is then hydrated by D-bifunctional protein <lb/>(DBP), which then oxidizes the C-24 hydroxy to a C-24 ketone via <lb/>HSD17B4 activity. The resulting product 3a,7a,12a-trihydroxy-<lb/>24-oxo-5b-cholestan-(25R)26-oyl-CoA is then oxidized by the <lb/>enzyme peroxisomal thiolase 2 (SPCx) to the thioester of cholic <lb/>acid ready for conjugation with glycine, taurine, or hydrolysis to the <lb/>free acid by peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT) (219, 220). <lb/>The acidic pathway starts with (25R)26-hydroxylation and <lb/>(25R)26-carboxylation of cholesterol by CYP27A1 and this and <lb/>many other steps may proceed extrahepatically (Figure 8). Most <lb/>of the enzymes involved in the neutral pathway are also involved <lb/>in the acidic pathway although not in the same order (361). An <lb/>exception is CYP7A1, which is replaced by CYP7B1 as the 7a-<lb/>hydroxylase in the acidic pathway. CYP7B1 is expressed in many <lb/>tissues, not just liver (362, 363), and unlike CYP7A1 uses side-<lb/>chain oxysterols as its substrate. The acidic pathway mostly <lb/>generates chenodeoxycholic acid rather than cholic acid, so <lb/>CYP8B1 has minor involvement. The order of A-ring <lb/>reduction and side-chain cleavage can be reversed in the acidic <lb/>pathway with the formation of bile acid intermediates possessing <lb/>3-oxo-4-ene or 3b-hydroxy-5-ene functions. <lb/>Steroid Hormone Biosynthesis <lb/>The classical steroid hormones aldosterone (mineralocorticoid), <lb/>cortisol (glucocorticoid), testosterone (male sex hormone) and <lb/>17b-estradiol (female sex hormone) are all formed from <lb/>FIGURE 7 | Biosynthetic pathways of oxidized phospholipids.

			<body>HSD17B3, respectively, while CYP19A1 is required to generate <lb/>estrogens. Besides being synthesized in the adrenal gland and sex <lb/>organs it is noteworthy that steroids can be synthesized in the <lb/>brain and are then named neurosteroids (366, 367). A more <lb/>general term for brain steroids which may be synthesized in the <lb/>brain or imported from the periphery and exert rapid non-<lb/>genomic effects is neuroactive steroids. It is beyond the scope of <lb/>this review to discuss steroid hormone biosynthesis and <lb/>metabolism in greater detail and the reader is directed to the <lb/>excellent reviews of Shackleton and colleagues (364, 368-370). <lb/>CONCLUDING REMARKS <lb/>Enzymatically oxidized lipids are derivatives of PUFA or cholesterol <lb/>with critical functions in cellular and physiological processes as <lb/>signaling mediators and hormones. Their biosynthesis is highly <lb/>regulated and carried out by enzymes that include LOXs, COXs, <lb/>CYPs, and AKRs. Advances in our understanding of these enzymes <lb/>have led to the discovery of novel lipid mediators and their <lb/>biosynthetic routes. Many functional aspects of these enzymes <lb/>and their products remain unclear, requiring further investigation. <lb/>These include elucidating the function of 15-LOX-2 (ALOX15B) in <lb/>macrophages, the regulatory mechanisms of 12-LOXs and eLOX3, <lb/>the mechanistic details of transcellular biosynthesis, the origin of 18-<lb/>HEPE required for E-resolvin biosynthesis, the biological functions <lb/>of orphan CYPs, and the bioactivities/functions of oxygenated <lb/>endocannabinoids. The relative physiological importance of some <lb/>multiply oxygenated PUFA mediators, which are generated in <lb/>extremely low amounts, also needs to be further clarified. This is <lb/>also true for multiply oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol. <lb/>Research on oxygenated PUFA and oxysterols has been <lb/>carried out largely in parallel, and both areas have benefited <lb/>greatly from advances in analytical methods. However, there are <lb/>still major questions to be answered in terms of their proposed <lb/>roles in human disease including atherosclerosis and <lb/>neurodegeneration. Here, we presented biosynthetic pathways <lb/>of oxygenated PUFA and oxysterols, highlighting their (known) <lb/>functions to show the diversity of products but also to draw <lb/>connections between the two groups. An integrated approach <lb/>encompassing the analysis of both lipid groups could be useful in <lb/>examining the etiology of disease. Despite their involvement in <lb/>the progression of disease such as atherosclerosis and <lb/>neurodegenerative disease, the two lipid groups are rarely <lb/>analyzed together. We propose that oxygenated PUFA and <lb/>oxysterols are more connected than previously thought, <lb/>especially as 15-LOX is being increasingly recognized as a <lb/>regulator of cholesterol metabolism. The immune and nervous <lb/>systems are both of particular interest as major sites of <lb/>cholesterol metabolism and 15-LOX expression. Further work <lb/>on the enzymology of 15-LOX with cholesteryl substrates could <lb/>lead to the discovery of novel oxidized lipids. For example, 15-<lb/>LOX oxygenation of PUFA esters of oxysterols could generate <lb/>novel lipids that link both classes directly in cell types that <lb/>possess the enzymatic machinery for oxysterol and oxylipin <lb/>biosyntheses (e.g., macrophages). An alternative biosynthetic <lb/>route could be through the esterification of oxylipins with free <lb/>oxysterols. That said, the detection of these proposed molecules <lb/>could be challenging due to low abundance and sensitivity to <lb/>alkaline conditions commonly used in analysis. Finally, the <lb/>substrate promiscuity of many of the enzymes involved in <lb/>production of oxidized lipids provides a technical challenge for <lb/>dissection of (patho)physiological function of specific oxidized <lb/>lipids. Clearly, there is plenty of scope for ongoing exploration of <lb/>the molecular, cellular, and physiological functions of <lb/>oxidized lipids. <lb/>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS <lb/>AH planned the manuscript.
